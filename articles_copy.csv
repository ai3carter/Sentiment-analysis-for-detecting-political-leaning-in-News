liberal,"Carrying a lethal weapon onto church property was considered ""inappropriate"" under the policies of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now, it's prohibited.
The tweaked language can be seen in the church's ""Handbook 2,"" which says: ""Churches are dedicated for the worship of God and as havens from the cares and concerns of the world. With the exception of current law enforcement officers, the carrying of lethal weapons on church property, concealed or otherwise, is prohibited.""
The previous rule said the carrying of lethal weapons was inappropriate.
Lethal weapons include a number of possible items including guns, said Daniel Woodruff,a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The handbook update took effect in the first week of August, Woodruff said, but the change will be formally communicated to local Church leaders as new meetinghouse safety guidelines in the near future.
Those leaders will then be responsible for sharing the guidelines with their members, he added.
The change applies to the entire church, but due to a Texas law change regarding firearms in places of worship, a letter referencing the prohibition was recently sent to church leaders in Texas and shared with members, Woodruff said.
Next month, a new law will go into effect in Texas which will allow licensed handgun owners to legally carry their weapons in places of worship.
It's one of a string of new firearm laws that will take effect across Texas next month, further loosening gun restrictions in a state that already has some of the most lax weapons laws in the nation.


One of those laws will disallow school districts from prohibiting licensed gun owners -- including school employees -- from storing a firearm or ammunition in a locked vehicle on a school parking lot, as long as they're not in plain view. Another will allow foster homes to store firearms and ammunition in a safe and secure place for personal protection.
The handbook tweak isn't the first change the church has seen in recent years.
It's undergone many others, including dropping the moniker ""Mormon,"" cutting an hour from Sunday church meetings, allowing missionaries to contact their families more often, ending the church's 100-year association with the Boy Scouts and dropping an anti-LGBT policy from 2015, saying children of same-sex couples can be baptized.

liberal,"There is a tiny bit of good news at the tail end of the trash fire that was 2019: A Nazi salute will, in some corners of America, get you fired.

All of those correctional cadets from the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Basic Training Class 18 who were photographed apparently giving a Nazi salute will be fired, thanks to the decision by West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to approve a recommendation from an internal report on the incident.
""We have a lot of good people in the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety,"" Justice said in a statement. ""But this incident was completely unacceptable.""
He said three staff members at the training academy will be fired. And four instructors who did not report the photograph will be suspended without pay.
Two trainers and a cadet were canned earlier, while 34 others were suspended without pay during the investigation of the photo, which was released Dec. 5 (with faces blurred) by the state's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. Some cadets said that they were ordered to raise their arm in a salute to a training instructor for their class identified only as ""Instructor Byrd."" 
Byrd told a member of the secretarial staff, according to the investigation by the department and its Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, to caption the photo ""Hail Byrd,"" ""because I'm a hard-ass like Hitler.""
There are two threads worth pulling apart here. First is the most obvious one: the glorification of Nazi violence. Hitler wasn't a ""hard-ass;"" he was a genocidal dictator who ordered and oversaw some of the worst atrocities in modern history (he was also, as most tyrants are, a pathetic and fearful little man). Hitler and his Nazis killed some 6 million Jews, and millions of others: people with disabilities, Roma people, gay people and those who dared stand up to him.


That's not a ""hard-ass."" That's a vicious, murderous anti-Semite and a man so vile it's hard to come up with appropriately derogatory descriptors. To encourage cadets to think of you like Hitler and, by extension, of themselves like Nazis? That's poison.
Anti-Semitism remains pervasive in the United States and around the world, surfacing in atrocities such as the stabbings carried out in Monsey, New York, last weekend. According to the New York Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic hate crimes are on the rise.
So good riddance to all of these Nazi-saluting cadets.
But there's something else here, too. If the cadets are gesturing like Nazis -- glorifying their obedience to a ""hard-ass"" leader, who exactly are they all collectively terrorizing? Nazis, after all, are menacing only because they have blameless, helpless victims.
These cadets were training to work in West Virginia's prisons, jails and juvenile correctional facilities. Correctional cadets are already entering a field where abuse is rife and where a sadistic streak of authoritarianism can too often be allowed to flourish.
West Virginia is 93% white, but, according to data from the advocacy group Prison Policy Initiative, nearly a third of its prisoners are black. Hispanic people are also over-represented in West Virginia correctional facilities. Prison guards have been accused of rape and other assaults in West Virginia prisons.
The treatment of prison populations, including children, is at the whim of corrections officers. Rogue guards have been known across the country to abuse their power and act with tremendous brutality toward inmates --too often effectively protected from punishment by union rules.
Within this larger context, this incident suggests the problem likely doesn't begin and end with these cadets, who, predictably, say they were just following orders -- in this case, from Instructor Byrd.
Firing everyone involved is the correct first step, but it can't be the last one. The West Virginia Department of Corrections needs an expansive investigation into the culture that made this photo seem like an acceptable idea in the first place -- however clueless the adult cadets claim to have been.
What else are cadets learning about their role supervising and keeping safe the incarcerated population? How are working guards treating the incarcerated? Are people in prison being kept safe in West Virginia, or is the tolerance for cruelty that this photo arguably suggests already being leveraged against people with few avenues for reporting, and who stand to pay a steep price for speaking out?
The cabinet secretary of West Virginia's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety and the commissioner of the department's Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation both recommended additional training, though neither was specific.
The photo was an ugly symbol of a murderous ideology. But firing the people who raised their arms in a Nazi salute does not root out any of the potential underlying rot among those in positions of authority over future key players in America's justice system. West Virginia needs to dig deeper to find what's festering underneath.

liberal,"McConnell Says Republicans Have Votes to Set Trump Trial Terms
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he has the votes to set the terms of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial without the cooperation of Democrats, which would allow him to reject their calls for an agreement on new witness testimony before it gets underway.
“We have the votes once the impeachment trial has begun” to begin hearing from the House impeachment managers and the president’s defense and to defer a decision on witnesses until after that phase is completed, McConnell said Tuesday after a lunch meeting with GOP senators.
The impeachment trial rules can be set by a simple majority of the 100-member chamber and Republicans hold 53 votes. McConnell said he hopes Speaker Nancy Pelosi will act this week to transmit the two articles of impeachment against Trump that were adopted by the House in December, which would trigger the start of the trial process.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer signaled that the time may be nearing to send the impeachment articles. He said Pelosi has “accomplished a great deal already” in holding on to the resolution because it thwarted any chance McConnell would move to immediately dismiss the charges and allowed a “cascade of evidence” to emerge.
But McConnell’s hold on his GOP majority hasn’t been shaken by any new revelations, including former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton’s offer to testify and recent leaks of emails showing the president’s direct involvement in holding up military aid to Ukraine after he pressed that country’s president to investigate potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son.
Despite demands from Democrats for a commitment to hear from Bolton and other administration officials and view other evidence, McConnell on Tuesday again insisted that the Senate use the same process as Bill Clinton’s 1999 impeachment trial.
Following the Clinton precedent gives McConnell maximum leverage because it would delay decisions on Democrats’ demands for testimony from administration figures including Bolton and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney until after Trump’s lawyers and House impeachment managers make their arguments and answer senators’ questions. That could buy him about two weeks to ensure Republicans stay united behind a strategy of blocking or limiting witnesses before he moves the Senate to a verdict.
The Clinton trial got underway exactly 21 years ago Tuesday. While there was a bipartisan consensus then on basic process -- including the amount of time for making opening arguments -- Republicans now are preparing to set the trial rules on a strictly party-line vote once the articles are presented and the senators are all sworn in as jurors.
“It would be better if 100 of us could do it, but the other option would be at that moment where 51 could act, that 51 would,” said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate GOP leadership team.
No talks have yet taken place between McConnell and Schumer to hammer out any kind of compromise, and none appears likely at this point.
Pelosi still hasn’t given any indication of when she plans to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a step that would trigger the start of the trial. Her allies argue that the Senate turning down Bolton’s offer to testify under subpoena would show that Republicans are trying to bury incriminating evidence against Trump.
Witnesses
“McConnell is making very plain he’s not interested in the country learning the full extent” of Trump’s misconduct, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Tuesday. “And apparently there are any number of senators willing to go along with that head-in-the-sand strategy.”
Schumer vowed to force early votes during the trial to call witnesses and documents blocked so far by Trump.
“There will be votes on the four witnesses we asked for,” the New York Democrat told reporters. “We are telling our Republican colleagues, you can run but you can’t hide.”
But GOP senators have been unmoved. McConnell’s lieutenants already are embracing his argument that it isn’t the Senate’s role to correct what he considers a “shoddy” impeachment by finding new evidence.
“I’m not sure it’s the Senate’s job to complete the House record,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican leader. “Our job is to pass judgment on the articles they sent us.”
Two Republicans who have on occasion broken with Trump and have criticized McConnell’s statements about the trial -- Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Susan Collins -- say they back his plan to follow the precedent of Clinton’s impeachment trial.
“I think we need to do what they did the last time they did this unfortunate process, and that was to go through a first phase and then they reassessed after that,” Murkowski said.
If just four Republicans want to hear from Bolton or anyone else, they can force an extension of the trial, but at this point no Republicans have said they would vote with Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents. Only Mitt Romney of Utah said he wants to hear from Bolton, but he stopped short of backing a subpoena to get it.
A partisan trial blocking fresh evidence holds risks for the handful of Republican senators facing tough races this fall -- such as Collins -- particularly if Bolton later divulges bombshell evidence or if other damaging documents withheld by Trump leak out after Republicans all voted in lockstep to protect the president’s secrets.
Some of those vulnerable Republicans, however, are expressing no such concerns. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who faces voters in November, said Monday he sees no need to add to the evidence assembled by the House despite Bolton’s offer to testify. Similar sentiments were expressed by other senators, including National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young of Indiana and Marco Rubio of Florida.
Young told reporters Monday it would create “a bad precedent if the Senate would try to improve upon defective articles of impeachment“ when asked about calling Bolton. “It’s not even something I’m considering.”"
liberal,"John Bolton Is Bluffing
If the former national security adviser has something to say, he could hold a press conference right now.
Noah Feldman is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He is a professor of law at Harvard University and was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter. His books include “The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President.” 
Has John Bolton had some sort of constitutional revelation? Back in November, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser made it clear that he would not testify voluntarily before the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, and that if subpoenaed he would go to court to ask for judicial direction. Yesterday, Bolton issued a statement indicating that if subpoenaed by the Senate during Trump’s trial, he would testify.
What changed? Although Bolton gave a constitutional explanation for his flip-flop, it’s difficult to see a coherent argument in it. The most likely explanation is politics: Bolton seems to be calculating that Senate leader Mitch McConnell will do everything he can to avoid allowing Bolton to be called. That would mean Bolton can now present himself as willing to testify without actually having to appear.
Bolton’s formal account of his change of position deserves attention — because his initial refusal to testify without a judicial order had a certain logic to it. The basic theory of Bolton’s old stance was that if subpoenaed to testify by the House, he would have faced a constitutional conflict between “a House committee subpoena on the one hand, and a Presidential directive not to testify on the other.”
This position rested on the idea that Trump’s orders to executive branch officials not to testify before Congress were lawful. I don’t buy that argument. The president has no authority to stonewall Congress or prohibit his employees from cooperating with an impeachment inquiry. The president’s blanket refusal was so outrageous that it forms the basis of the second article of impeachment approved by the House.
Nonetheless, going to court to get guidance wasn’t a ridiculous idea; while Bolton couldn’t defensibly rely on the legality of Trump’s order, it was plausible that he still should have been exempt from testifying. As national security adviser, his communications with the president could conceivably have been protected by executive privilege. The idea of executive privilege is found in the Supreme Court’s famous decision in the Nixon Watergate tapes case. It’s probably at its peak when it protects national security conversations between the president and his highest advisers — like Bolton. Bolton could have agreed to appear before the House and then asserted executive privilege for questions he didn’t want to answer. (Notice that Bolton still hasn’t said whether he would invoke executive privilege in response to some questions that might be posed to him in a Senate trial.)
But Bolton now says that “It does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts.” He concludes:
Accordingly, since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.
If Bolton can now “resolve the serious competing issues” on his own, why couldn’t he do it two months ago?
That’s not the only problem with his reasoning. Bolton also notes that the House has now voted and that it “falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments.” But the House was fulfilling its constitutional duty, too, when it sought testimony. The only reason the House didn’t call Bolton was that he’d already made it clear he would trigger a court battle that could potentially delay the impeachment process.
It’s possible, of course, that Bolton now actually wants to be called to testify. Maybe he thinks that history will judge him poorly for remaining silent. But if Bolton really wanted to tell his story, nothing stops him from holding a press conference and doing so.
Yet it is tempting to attribute a more complex motive to Bolton, who has always been known for his extremely sophisticated bureaucratic maneuvering. Bolton is declaring his willingness to testify at precisely the moment when it seems increasingly clear that McConnell and the Senate Republicans won’t agree with Democratic requests to agree on key witnesses before the trial begins. That gives Bolton the freedom to say he would testify, appearing superficially cooperative, while likely avoiding actually being called.
The upshot would be that the historical record would eventually come to reflect Bolton’s statement of willingness to testify, not his earlier refusal — all without Bolton actually testifying. That would split the difference for Bolton. And it would leave the American people still in the dark about what the national security adviser could tell us about Trump’s impeachable conduct."
liberal,"U.S. Stock Futures Tumble, With Investors Rattled by Iran Strike
U.S. stock index futures tumbled after Iran launched missiles at American bases in Iraq, escalating tensions in the Middle East that threatened to upend the global economy.
Contracts on the S&P 500 Index slid 1.3% as of 10:15 a.m. in Tokyo, after the Pentagon said Iran fired a series of rockets at two airbases that housed American troops early Wednesday morning Baghdad time. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index dropped as much as 1.7% and those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4%.
The sell-off shattered the uneasy calm that had prevailed on American equities markets this week even as Iran repeatedly threatened to retaliate after the U.S. killed a top general Friday, an attack that briefly roiled financial markets. Wednesday’s escalation rekindled the flight to safety after a two-day reprieve, sending gold above $1,600 an ounce and rattling equity markets around the globe. Oil surged.
“The market didn’t price the chance of a major conflict high enough when the U.S. drone strike happened,” said Max Gokhman, the head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “Now it’s more clear the situation won’t de-escalate and fear is replacing hope in investors’ minds.”
It wasn’t immediately clear if there were casualties or major damage, but the strikes heightened fears that the situation will widen into a broader conflict that could ripple across global financial markets. U.S. President Donald Trump had vowed a quick and overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks.
“It is important to note that President Trump was very clear that the U.S. would deliver a heavy-handed response to any Iranian retaliation,” Michael O’Rourke, JonesTrading’s chief market strategist, wrote to clients. “Futures should not only be reacting to the Iranian attack, but also to the clear escalation that will be the impending U.S. escalation.”
The S&P 500 is coming off one of its best year’s of the bull market, rising 29% in 2019 amid a cooling of trade tensions, signs of rising global growth and concerted central bank easing. Risk markets had looked past geopolitical tensions, from North Korea to the Middle East, on speculation central banks stood ready to continue supporting growth. Volatility that had remained tepid throughout the latter part of the year is now likely to spike higher.
“Clearly a myriad of uncertainties remain around a potential U.S. counter strike and any further reprisals which will subdue risk appetite and see volatility whipsaw markets once again,” said Eleanor Creagh, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets."
liberal,"Greek Leader Says He Will Discuss ‘Aggressive’ Turkey With Trump
Greece is getting worried about Turkey’s efforts to impose its authority on the eastern Mediterranean and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis plans to raise the issue with Donald Trump.
The Greeks are concerned that Turkey could start drilling for oil and gas in its waters after its neighbor sealed a maritime-border deal with Libya in December. Ankara is already locked in a dispute with the European Union over its exploration activities off the coast of Cyprus and officials in Athens would feel obliged to respond if Turkey repeated that maneuver in a stretch of sea recognized as Greek by an international maritime treaty.
Turkey added to the tensions by agreeing to send troops to support the UN-backed government in Libya.
Turkey is behaving in an “aggressive manner,” Mitsotakis said at the Atlantic Council in Washington Tuesday . “It’s unacceptable to have a NATO ally member provoke another ally member and this shouldn’t be brushed aside in the context of the alliance,” he said.
Mitsotakis said Sunday he will discuss with President Trump the dangers that Turkey’s behavior raises for peace and security in the region.
The Greek premier plans to make the case to Trump at a meeting Tuesday that Greece provides stability in a volatile part of the world, an official in Athens said.
Following the contentious maritime deal early last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan secured a one-year mandate on Jan. 2 to send troops to Libya following a request from its prime minister, Fayez Mustafa Al-Sarraj. The move triggered protests from the U.S., Italy, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt as well as Greece.
Turkish parliamentary approval for the troop deployment came on the day that Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed an agreement for the construction of the EastMed gas pipeline that will connect the eastern Mediterranean basin to Europe. That deal, backed by the U.S., provoked Turkey’s objections.
Any project that disregards Turkey “cannot succeed,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said.
“Greece won’t tolerate any infringement of our sovereign rights in our exclusive economic zone,” Mitsotakis said in Washington. Greece and the U.S. will also discuss ways to strengthen the strategic relationship between the two countries, he said.
Military Cooperation
During the meeting with Trump, the Greek premier will argue that Turkey’s actions are destabilizing and that Erdogan’s government has pursued a stream of initiatives that undermine western interests.
Mitsotakis wants to strengthen Greece’s defense capabilities by upgrading its U.S.-made F-16 fighters and will raise the possibility of buying the more sophisticated F-35 fighters with Trump. He also wants to discuss the possibility of a joint project to manufacture military drones and security issues relating to the roll out of 5G networks.
In October, the U.S. and Greece signed a mutual defense cooperation agreement that envisages U.S. forces using part of Alexandroupolis port, close to the Turkish border. Under the deal, U.S. liquefied natural gas will also be imported to an offshore storage and regasification unit in Greece.
The business-friendly premier will meet with investors during his two-day visit to Washington, as he tries to attract funds to an economy that has lost about 25% of its output during the debt crisis.
Mitsotakis will also hold talks with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a bid to negotiate more room to maneuver on Greece’s budget.
Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a dinner for Mitsotakis on Wednesday night."
liberal,"Indonesia Will Not Negotiate Its Sovereignty in South China Sea
Indonesia will not compromise on its sovereignty in the South China Sea amid the recent sighting of Chinese fishing vessels near the Natuna Islands, which lie between Malaysia and Borneo, President Joko Widodo said.
Speaking at a plenary cabinet session in Jakarta Monday, Jokowi, as Widodo is known, said the increased presence of Chinese ships in the disputed waters since December was a violation of international law. He said in a statement posted on the cabinet secretariat website there would be “no negotiation when it comes to our sovereignty.”
Jokowi is scheduled to visit Natuna on Wednesday, according to Defrizal, head of communications at the Natuna regency who goes by one name, while the Indonesian Air Force had deployed four F-16 fighter jets to the islands, Detik news site reported on Tuesday.
Indonesia has also stepped up patrols in the gas-rich area, deploying five ships and two aircraft last week. On Monday, the navy dispatched additional warships to the area, Channel News Asia reported citing Commander Fajar Tri Rohadi, a public affairs officer with the First Fleet Command of the Indonesia Navy.
“This is our sovereign right,” Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said after the cabinet meeting, urging China to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. “Indonesia will never recognize nine dash lines or unilateral claims made by China that do not have legal reasons recognized by international law.”
The latest conflict follows accusations by the U.S. and other coastal states in Southeast Asia that China was taking a more aggressive stance on its claims to more than 80% of the lucrative waters in the South China Sea. China has said it’s operating legally, and has called on the U.S. to stop interfering in the region.
There were several reported incidents involving Chinese coast guard vessels entering waters controlled by other claimants last year, including one that resulted in a nearly four-month-long standoff with Vietnam. Malaysia also drew an objection from Beijing on Dec. 12 when it issued a submission to the UN defining its continental shelf.
Sovereignty Battle
The incident began more than two weeks ago when Chinese coast guard vessels escorting dozens of fishing vessels were spotted in Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone, the Jakarta Post reported, triggering the foreign ministry to send a diplomatic protest to Beijing on Dec 30.
China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the next day the country has sovereignty over the nearby Spratly Islands and their waters in the northeast, which had for years been traditional Chinese fishing grounds.
“The China coast guard were performing their duty by carrying out routine patrols to maintain maritime order and protect our people’s legitimate rights and interests in the relevant waters,” Geng said during a regular briefing.
Last year, the Indonesian government announced plans to develop the lucrative fishing grounds near Natuna in part to assert its sovereign authority there. It also pledged to build new cold-storage facilities to turn the area into a functional fishing hub by the year’s end. In addition to the navy, Mahfud MD, coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs, said on Monday 120 fishing vessels had been called in to further reinforce patrols.
“Aside from using your rights as a citizen, you are also obligated to help defend the country, showing that this is ours,” Mahfud said in a statement on the coordinating ministry website.
This is not the first time the two sides have faced conflict near Natuna. Indonesia has for years fended off Chinese fisherman caught poaching in its waters -- confiscating and destroying hundreds of boats. While Indonesia has sought to remain neutral in the wider dispute, Jokowi also offered a similar statement on Indonesia’s sovereignty in May 2016 following several incursions by Chinese fishing boats and its coast guard.
“This is how it has responded since the 2016 incursions. So if there was posturing, it was back then,” said Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Southeast Asian Political Change and Foreign Policy program. “Indonesian policy has been remarkably consistent on this issue.”"
liberal,"Why China Won’t Join Any Iran-Russia Coalition Against Trump
Beijing’s muted response to the U.S.’s killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani suggests China still isn’t ready to join Russia in taking a more direct role in the Middle East’s entrenched conflicts.
While Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was “highly concerned” by the action and called it “unacceptable,” he didn’t use words like “condemn” or “denounce” like his Iranian and Russian counterparts, Javad Zarif and Sergei Lavrov. Instead, he told Zarif that China would “play a constructive role” to help safeguard regional security and said on a call with Lavrov that “all parties” must uphold international law.
The comments were consistent with China’s past efforts to avoid commitments in a region where it could clash with the U.S. and its allies. Beijing has so far done little to counter President Donald Trump’s effort to ratchet up pressure on Tehran, beyond defending the Iran nuclear deal and criticizing the U.S.’s unilateral sanctions.
On Monday, the U.S. accused China of siding with Russia at the United Nations to block a Security Council resolution condemning the attack on the American embassy in Baghdad that precipitated Trump’s decision to order the strike at Soleimani. The U.S. mission to the UN said the move “calls the council’s credibility into question.” 
There’s little to indicate that Soleimani’s death will spur China to stray far from its past balancing act, especially as President Xi Jinping seeks to wrap up preliminary trade negotiations with Trump this month. While China has stepped up military cooperation with Russia and expanded ties with Tehran, it also relies on Iran’s rival Saudi Arabia as its top supplier of foreign oil.
“China is caught up in a dilemma where it doesn’t want to provoke the Trump administration, has a deepening strategic partnership with Russia while has its own interest at stake in Iran,” said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to China’s cabinet and also a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I expect the Chinese government to stick to a mild tone, calling on both sides to exercise restraint and refrain from escalating tensions.”
China and Russia have enhanced military ties in recent years, conducting joint naval drills annually and coordinating security policies across Asia through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Xi and Vladimir Putin have met more than 30 times since 2013, with the Chinese leader calling his Russian counterpart his “closest foreign colleague.” Putin has said Russia-China cooperation reached an “unprecedentedly high level.”
Still, they are unlikely to team up in a Middle East conflict. Although Chinese officials have repeatedly blasted U.S. actions against its own trade and security interests, they have opted for a lower-key response to Washington’s disputes with Beijing’s diplomatic partners. China avoided moves to stop American efforts to oust its long-time diplomatic patron Nicolas Maduro, saying only it was a domestic affair that should be resolved by the Venezuelan people.
Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of the Eurasia Group, told Bloomberg Television on Monday that China has a different objective from Russia in the Middle East. “The Russians actually want chaos. The Chinese want stability,” Bremmer said. 
Similarly, China has dramatically scaled back its purchases of Iranian oil since the U.S. ended sanctions waivers last year, importing less than 548,000 tones of crude in November compared with just over 3 million in April. China remains Iran’s biggest oil buyer, but it bought five times as much from Saudi Arabia in the first 11 months of last year.
It’s unclear what it would take for China, which boasts the world’s second-biggest economy and defense budget, to take a more assertive role in the Middle East. Last month, China hosted Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, for a visit to Beijing and participated in joint naval drills with Iran and Russia in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Oman.
“The Russians actually want chaos. The Chinese want stability.”
--Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group
Li Guofu, a former Chinese diplomat to the U.S. and director of the China Institute of International Studies’ Center for Middle East Studies, said foreign powers had few options to discourage Trump from his “law-of-the-jungle” decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. “In this case, other countries can do very little to possibly change the status quo,” Li said.
Trump has at times suggested that he would like to see Xi come off the sidelines in the Middle East, saying in a June tweet that countries like China should start protecting their own oil shipments through the Persian Gulf. China’s foreign ministry sidestepped a question Monday about whether the country would consider a larger security role in the Middle East.
“The worsening of the situation in the gulf is not in the interests of anyone,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing. “We oppose the abuse of force in international relations. We call on all relevant parties to exercise restraint, avoid the spiral of escalation and make efforts to cool down the situation.”
China could use its platform as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to criticize U.S. actions against Iran, a role that Wang Yi mentioned in his statement on the Soleimani killing. Still, Beijing would delay such a move for as long as possible, according to Shi, the Renmin University professor.
“China will not take sides in the UN Security Council until it has to,” Shi said."
liberal,"Stocks Plunge on Iran Escalation; Gold, Oil Surge: Markets Wrap
U.S. stock futures slumped along with Asian equities and oil prices surged after Iran started an attack on military facilities in Iraq hosting American troops, escalating tensions in the Middle East. Treasuries and the yen rose as haven assets caught a bid.
Futures on the S&P 500 Index dropped more than 1%, though moves did ease somewhat with benchmark U.S. Treasury yields off their session lows. Iran fired several rockets at two joint U.S.-Iraqi bases early Wednesday morning in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian military leader by the U.S. Japanese shares headed for the biggest slide since March, with equities also lower in Hong Kong and Sydney, while shares in Shanghai outperformed. Gold advanced to the highest since 2013.
“Markets will likely remain nervous,” Mitul Kotecha, a strategist at TD Securities, said. “Much now depends on the U.S. reaction and whether there is further escalation.”
Caution is returning to markets after a bumper 2019 for a range of asset classes amid signs hostilities are moving on to the next stage following the airstrike that killed General Qassem Soleimani last week. Meantime, investors continue to weigh developments on the trade front with the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal expected by many to be signed on Jan. 15.

liberal,"Trump’s Targeted Iran Killing Is Kim Jong Un’s Biggest Fear
If Kim Jong Un needed another reminder about the risks of bargaining away North Korea’s nuclear weapons program to the U.S., President Donald Trump’s decision to kill one of Iran’s top commanders provides one.
The killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last week reinforces the North Korean view that the U.S. only takes such actions against states that lack a credible nuclear deterrent. More specifically, Trump’s choice of attack -- a covert drone strike against a high-level target -- feeds regime fears that any U.S. offensive against Pyongyang would start at the top.
“The attack will only entrench the belief in Pyongyang that a nuclear deterrent, which Iran lacks, is essential for the physical survival of Kim Jong Un,” said Miha Hribernik, head of Asia risk analysis at Verisk Maplecroft. “Kim and other senior North Korean officials could, in theory, be targeted the same way in the future.”
The Soleimani killing came at a precarious time for Trump’s nuclear talks with North Korea, just two days after Kim announced that he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major weapons tests and vowed “shocking” action against the U.S. While the strike may give Kim pause about how far he can push Trump in the coming months, it also reaffirms the dangers of meeting American disarmament demands.
Those concerns have long weighed on talks with North Korea, which has allowed only a brief report on China and Russia condemning the “U.S. missile attack” against Iran to appear in its state-run media. The regime already had cautionary tales such as the death of Libya’s Moammar Qaddafi, whom the U.S. helped topple less than a decade after he gave up his own nuclear weapons.
 Just weeks before Trump’s first unprecedented meeting with Kim in June 2018, then-U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton proposed that North Korea adopt the “Libya model” of disarmament -- a remark that the president disavowed. Around the same time, Trump further complicated the Kim summit by withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation deal that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, reached with Iran.
That decision raised questions about what sort of agreement the Trump administration could reach with North Korea, which, unlike Iran, has already demonstrated its possession of nuclear bombs and missiles capable of carrying them to the continental U.S. Last week, Kim told a gathering of ruling party leaders in Pyongyang that he would soon debut a “new strategic weapon” and ruled out denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula “until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy.”
The Soleimani killing makes the possibility of a U.S. “decapitation strike” against North Korea seem less remote if the relationship between Trump and Kim further breaks down. The regime has accused the American side of plotting to kill Kim as recently as 2017, a claim bolstered by subsequent revelations that the country’s hackers had stolen secret allied military plans to take out the Pyongyang leadership.
‘Warning Sign’
Andrei Lankov, the Seoul-based director of the Korea Risk Group consulting firm, said Trump’s latest move will be viewed as a “warning sign” by those in North Korea who may have read his decisions to meet Kim and call off an earlier strike against Iran as weakness. “They will behave far more carefully with far more reserve than they would do otherwise,” Lankov said.
Although it was difficult to assess how the incident was being received within the secretive state, there was no obvious change in Kim’s behavior. State media published a report on Tuesday showing Kim making what appeared to be a routine visit to a factory site, unlike his late father, Kim Jong Il, who withdrew from public view for weeks after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Harry Harris, called on Seoul to send forces to help protect shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, saying in an interview with TV broadcaster KBS that it would be in the country’s interests because it imports “so much of” its energy from the Middle East.
U.S. policy makers have long lumped North Korea with Iran, such as when then-President George W. Bush listed the two countries alongside Iraq in his “axis of evil” speech in 2002. The National Defense Strategy published by the Trump administration in 2018 described North Korea and Iran as two “rogue regimes” whose actions were destabilizing their respective regions.
“North Korean state media often is implicitly sympathetic to Iran,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a specialist on North Korea at Seoul-based NK Pro. “It often cites the Iranian government’s position on foreign policy and weapons’ development issues, and criticizes the U.S.’s policy of ‘pressure’ on countries such as Iran.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told visiting North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, in 2018 that the U.S. “is recognized today as an unreliable and untrustworthy country.” Last week, North Korean media published new year’s greetings from Rouhani, repeating a long-held line that the two states are unjustly targeted by Washington.
Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. diplomat specializing in Korean Peninsula issues, said such symbolic ties would make North Korea pay close attention to how the U.S.-Iran conflict unfolds after the strike on Soleimani.
“What’s happening to Iran now must certainly make Pyongyang confident in the priority it has put on a credible nuclear deterrent,” Oba said."
liberal,"Wall Street Is Gaming Out All the Possible U.S.-Iran Scenarios
Investors and analysts returning to work this week after the festive break found an unwanted item on their desks: a geopolitical puzzle with a bevy of players, complex rules and no clear solution. They’ve spent every minute since trying to figure it out.
As the market turmoil sparked by the U.S. killing of an Iranian military leader eases, Wall Street is mapping out scenarios that range from retaliation by Tehran through proxies to tit-for-tat escalations.
The threat appeared to intensify Tuesday after Iran said it is evaluating 13 possible ways to inflict a “historic nightmare” on America, while dozens were killed in a stampede at the general’s funeral.
“The market is underestimating the risk,” said Fabrizio Fiorini, the chief investment officer at Pramerica Sgr Spa in Milan. “Investors are forgetting that equity is discounting a perfect alignment of planets in terms of monetary and fiscal stimulus and economic rebound and political stability. What happened in Iraq is suggesting that the planets are not aligned.”
Here’s a look at some of the scenarios money managers and strategists are considering, in their own words:
BlackRock
Base case: Iranian retaliation is likely; energy infrastructure in the region is particularly vulnerable.
Status quo: We prefer U.S. Treasuries to lower-yielding peers as portfolio ballast and like inflation-protected securities against inflation risks.
Escalation: We believe markets are underestimating political risks, especially in the Gulf, North Korea and in cyberspace.
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Base case: Tensions are high and risk is elevated, but Iran and the U.S. have constraints that likely limit escalation.
Status quo: Possible near-term Iranian retaliation includes attacks against Israel using Hezbollah, proxy escalations in northern Iraq and cyberattacks. Iran could pursue a more aggressive strategy, but the regime remains mindful of U.S. military power. Meanwhile, election-year politics likely limit U.S. engagement.
Escalation: The primary threat to oil prices is an Iranian escalation that draws catastrophic U.S. reprisal. Middle East military escalation historically meant higher oil prices, but as we wrote in The New Economics of Oil, even a major escalation would likely drive prices for only a short time.
Nomura International
Base case: The more likely scenario involves a retaliation from Iran, but not enough to spark an outright war with the U.S.
Status quo: Even if we assign relatively a high probability (of around 80%) to the scenario of no severe escalation and maintain our view that the positive themes of U.S.-China trade, improving global data and a bottoming of the semiconductor down-cycle continue, the risk-reward of holding our current level of positive Asia risk has fallen from what it was a few weeks ago. Thus, we reduce some of our outright short USD/Asia FX positions.
Escalation: The risk that the situation in the Middle East could intensify is undeniable and, if this occurs, it could lead to a further rise in crude oil prices and risk reduction. The sensitivity of major currencies to crude oil prices and global stock prices since October 2019 indicates that JPY appreciation is likely to become evident when crude oil prices rise during risk-off periods. Thus, in the short term, JPY long positions are effective as a hedge against the worsening situation in the Middle East.
Rabobank
Base case: A nervous waiting game is likely to continue as investors brace themselves for Iran’s retaliation. It is worth noting that gold is trading only modestly below the recent high and USD/JPY is struggling to gain a better upside traction following its recent fall.
Status quo: An indication that geopolitical risk remains elevated is Brent crude holding well above the pre-Iran crisis level. The sharp spike in oil does not bode well for energy importers. In the CEEMEA space Turkey and South Africa are particularly vulnerable as domestic factors are a major source of risk as well.
Escalation: Geopolitical tensions may escalate substantially in the coming days as Iran is reportedly assessing 13 scenarios to revenge the killing of Qassem Soleimani.
TD Securities
Base case: The reality is nobody can say with any confidence how the U.S.-Iran tensions will evolve. As such, the TD securities team would be keeping an open mind to changing the crude oil view should tensions escalate into 2020.
Status quo: For now, the recent oil spike is being faded as we take at face value Iran’s “promise” to stick to military targets and keep any retaliation proportional.
Escalation: The risk of increasing geopolitical tensions and a potential negative supply shock originating from the oil market could well mean that gold can move north of $1,600 should tensions escalate further, which also would help to send the rest of the precious metals complex to new multi-year highs."
liberal,"Gold Tops $1,600 After Iran Attacks Spark Flight to Havens
Gold surged above $1,600 an ounce for the first time in more than six years after Iran attacked military facilities in Iraq hosting American troops in its first retaliation to the killing of a top general by U.S. forces last week.
Prices jumped more than 2% after Iran fired a series of rockets at two U.S.-Iraqi bases early Wednesday morning Baghdad time. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps earlier claimed responsibility for the barrage, which the Pentagon said was launched from Iran and targeted the Ayn al-Asad base in western Iraq and another facility in Erbil. It wasn’t immediately clear whether there were casualties or major damage from the attacks.
Bullion is off to a scorching start in 2020, with investors in thrall to the rising hostilities in the Middle East. Prices are building on their biggest annual gain in almost a decade, which was driven in part by easier monetary policy by central banks and global growth concerns.
Spot bullion climbed as much as 2.4% to $1,611.42 an ounce, the highest since 2013, and traded at $1,600.95 at 9:28 a.m. in Singapore. Futures jumped as much as 2.5%. Silver also surged, while platinum advanced and palladium fell.
Investors will turn their attention to the U.S. response, the scope of which could depend heavily on the damage and whether any Americans were killed or injured in the strikes. President Donald Trump has shown restraint in previous attacks in the region blamed on Iran that didn’t kill any U.S. citizens, but Iran’s quick claim of responsibility for the strike and the targeting of U.S. military outposts make some sort of retaliation more likely."
liberal,"Facebook Tightens Policy Against Deepfakes Ahead of Election
Facebook Inc. has shed more light on its efforts to eradicate doctored videos known as deepfakes, addressing an issue it has identified as an emergent threat ahead of the U.S. election.
The operator of the world’s largest social network pledged to remove content that has been “edited or synthesized” beyond adjustments for quality or clarity and is deemed likely to mislead viewers. The new rules won’t apply to parody or satire, however. And videos that don’t immediately meet Facebook’s internal criteria for removal may still get fact-checked by more than 50 organizations the company has partnered with worldwide. Facebook will collaborate with Reuters to help newsrooms spot deepfakes through free online courses.
Facebook was widely criticized last year for not reacting faster to a widely seen video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had been edited to make it look as though she was slurring her speech. It took Facebook more than a day to label the video as “fake,” at which point its distribution was limited by Facebook’s algorithms, but the company didn’t remove it altogether. Dozens of Democrats signed a letter to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, accusing him of not taking the situation seriously and saying that Facebook would be “grossly unprepared” for the 2020 elections.
“Facebook wants you to think the problem is video-editing technology, but the real problem is Facebook’s refusal to stop the spread of disinformation,” said Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, in a tweet Tuesday.
The video wasn’t technically a “deepfake,” which would mean it was completely fabricated, but still introduced Facebook to the kinds of misinformation it will face heading into the 2020 election.
“We are strengthening our policy toward misleading manipulated videos that have been identified as deepfakes,” Vice President of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert wrote in the blog post. “While these videos are still rare on the internet, they present a significant challenge for our industry and society as their use increases.”
Other U.S. internet giants are also tightening up on content ahead of the elections. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is restricting misinformation and banning deepfakes in ads following criticism that companies ran ads from U.S. President Donald Trump that were intentionally misleading. Facebook’s policy details were first reported by the Washington Post."
liberal,"Sweet Revenge for Iran Would Be to Push U.S. Out of Iraq
Perhaps the sweetest revenge Iran could take for Qassem Soleimani’s killing would be to secure what the military commander was unable to achieve in life: expulsion of the U.S. from neighboring Iraq.

That goal has come a step closer with Iraq’s parliament directing the government to cancel a standing request to host U.S. forces, and the leak of a draft U.S. letter accepting the “sovereign” decision and informing of preparations for departure.
But President Donald Trump said Tuesday it isn’t the right time for the U.S. to pull out of Iraq. “Eventually we want to be able to allow Iraq to run its own affairs,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “This isn’t the right point.”
U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was adamant on Monday that “there’s been no decision made to leave Iraq. Period.” U.S. officials said the letter was no more than a draft and should never have been made public.
Adding to the sense of confusion, Trump tweeted a threat to impose sweeping sanctions on Iraq, if it should kick American troops out without compensation.
“Iran believes with good reason it now has a chance to accomplish what it has been trying to do for many years, to push the U.S. out,” said William Wechsler, a former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Combating Terrorism, who now heads the Middle East program of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.
Iraq’s Pro-Iran Militias 
Sunday’s non-binding resolution marks just the beginning of a negotiation, rather than the end of the road for 17 years of close U.S. involvement in Iraq, according to Iraqi legislators and analysts, as well as Wechsler. The irony, he said, is that coming after months of anti-Iranian protests in Iraq, “this is all happening at a moment when the Iranian influence in Iraq had been under the greatest pressure since we invaded.”
Islamic State
Any negotiation of a U.S. draw-down may first have to be done among Iraq’s different political factions, which break down largely along religious and ethnic lines. In a country that has been gradually rebuilding a sense of nationhood since the bloody sectarianism that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, Iraq’s minorities in particular see the U.S. as a guarantor against Iranian influence, Shiite domination and the return of Islamic State.

The vote to expel the U.S. was boycotted by most Sunni Arab and Kurdish MPs, passing by 170 ballots to none against in a chamber of 328 legislators. Even as parliament met, crowds that have been protesting government policy and Iranian influence since October were still on the streets of many towns.
In Nasiriya, a mainly Shiite city of about half a million inhabitants 225 miles south of Baghdad, protesters blocked an attempted funeral procession for Soleimani at the weekend, even as large crowds attended a massive ceremony in his honor in Kerbala, the site of a holy shrine closer to the capital. The Nasiriya protesters then set fire to an office of the Popular Mobilization Units, the umbrella organization that includes pro-Iran militias.
“Those who were out to protest Iranian or U.S. influence are Iraqis, and they don’t want Iraq to be an arena to settle accounts,” said one protester, Ayad Al-Rumi, speaking by phone from Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. “We’re working to build a new Iraqi state, away from all the plans drawn by other countries.”

Firepower and Clout
Like so many protesters for better government, from Iran to Chile or Hong Kong, they may not get their way, and their message -- which already drew violent attacks before Soleimani’s death -- requires increasing bravery. Iraq’s pro-Iranian militias wield significant firepower and political clout, and the U.S. remains deeply unpopular with a significant part of the population.
Since invading to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003, the U.S. has spent an estimated $1 trillion dollars on operations in Iraq and lost more than 4,000 troops. But the impact on Iraq was devastating, and the U.S. -- which in recent years often appeared mainly interested in countering Islamic State or Iran in Iraq -- is unpopular among much of the population.
 “The decision was based on saving Iraq’s sovereignty, security and interests,” said Ahmed Al-Asadi, a Shiite lawmaker who backed Sunday’s vote to recommend expelling U.S. forces. “One of its main goals is to spare Iraq from any repercussions that may occur in the region.” With Islamic State defeated, he added, that decision “should have been taken in the past.”

What happens next remains opaque. Caretaker Prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has indicated he will act on the legislation, but its wording is vague, making it unclear exactly what the consequences for U.S. personnel would be.
Iraqis have for years resisted pressure from the U.S. and Iran alike to choose between them, reluctant to become overly dependent on either. That has thwarted Washington’s more ambitious goals in Iraq, but also Soleimani’s designs for turning the country into a second Lebanon, run by a compliant Shiite party and associated militia, akin to Hezbollah.
Economic Embargo
Many Iraqi politicians appear aware that air power and training provided by the U.S.-led coalition has been vital to the campaign to suppress Islamic State, which at one point controlled swathes of the country.

 “Can the Iraqi government give a guarantee that it doesn’t need the coalition forces in military, security, intelligence and economic terms?” said Vian Sabri, a lawmaker from the Kurdistan Democratic Party. “Security-wise, ISIS still exist as an ideology and group.”

Many also recognize the risks of being forced by an enraged U.S. president to join Iran’s economically devastating isolation from global financial and investment markets.
“Anyone who lived the days of the economic embargo in the 1990s will feel the magnitude of the catastrophe that will befall us,” said Ihsan Al-Shammari, the director of Baghdad’s Political Thought Center and ex-press adviser to former Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi.

Even if a new government should implement the resolution, it could amount to less than it seems, according to Abdullah Al-Kharbeet, a Sunni lawmaker who described the vote as “ink on paper” with no value or legal consequences.
A dis-invitation to U.S. troops could still allow for trainers to continue working with the Iraqi armed forces, and for U.S. jets to fly counter-Islamic State operations from the northern provinces of Kurdistan. Monday’s leaked letter has added to uncertainty over U.S. intentions.
“People don’t want to be subordinate,” said Al-Kharbeet, “neither to the U.S. nor to Iran, nor even to politicians.”"
liberal,"Putin Now Needs a Plan B on Iran
Having to re-aim?
Leonid Bershidsky is Bloomberg Opinion's Europe columnist. He was the founding editor of the Russian business daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. 
Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, killed last week by a U.S. drone in Baghdad, has been credited with persuading Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene militarily in Syria in 2015, a claim the Kremlin denies. Regardless of the truth of that particular story, though, the inevitable escalation following Soleimani’s death has the potential to change Putin’s calculus in the region.
Commenting on Soleimani’s demise, the Russian Defense Ministry praised his “indisputable contribution” to defeating the Islamic State in Syria. The ministry credited him for organizing an armed resistance to ISIS long before the U.S. created its own anti-ISIS coalition. Indeed, if it weren’t for Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and other regional armed groups, it would have made no sense for Russia to enter the Syrian conflict.
Hezbollah and Iranian forces commanded by Soleimani provided the boots on the grounds that Russia was unwilling to spare, supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s bloodied and exhausted troops to turn the tables on Assad’s enemies, including the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. It was important to Putin that Assad didn’t stand alone. If that were the case, he’d be easier to write off than to back.
Some analysts have argued that it’s always been in Russia’s interest to limit Iran’s role in Syria, because the Kremlin has no control over Iran or Hezbollah. That argument, however, assumes that Russia wants control. Putin, for his part, never wanted to own the Syrian crisis, but rather to prop up forces willing to consider Russia’s economic and military interests ahead of U.S. ones. That meant maintaining the status quo — and from Moscow, the Axis of Resistance, not just the Assad regime, was the status quo. Alexander Zasypkin, the Russian ambassador to Lebanon, said this in a March, 2019 interview:
I’ll say it straight: The Iranian influence on the Syrian regime shouldn’t be restricted. A strong, unshakable alliance exists among Damascus, Tehran and Hezbollah. It’ll remain that way in the future.
At the same time, Russian diplomats and Putin himself have avoided calling Iran a Russian ally. To them, it was merely the central part of a geopolitical arrangement that they didn’t want replaced with a pro-U.S. one. That’s an important distinction. An alliance is defined by mutual commitments. But when it comes to the Iranian regime, Putin has avoided any kind of serious commitment. In an attempt to set himself up as a Middle Eastern mediator rather than part of one of the region’s warring camps, he’s cooperated with Iran’s arch-enemy, Israel, and with Turkey, whose regional ambitions sometimes clash with Iran’s.
Soleimani’s death changes nothing about this basic setup. All Russia feels compelled to do is offer condolences, as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif; express concern, as Putin did to French President Emmanuel Macron; and keep up its military cooperation with Soleimani’s successor, Esmail Ghaani. Putin won’t back any Iranian attempts at retaliation.
Yet he will need to react if Iran does retaliate and the situation gets out of hand. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has even likened Soleimani’s killing to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, the event that set off World War I. One possible scenario he described was an Iranian strike on Israel and an Israeli response against Iranian forces and proxies in Syria, which might endanger Russian troops. Putin has planned a visit to Israel this month; deconfliction in Syria will be one of the key subjects of his discussions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On a strategic level, further escalation between Iran and the U.S. might disturb the geopolitical balance that Russia intervened in Syria to maintain. That’s something Putin wants to prevent with the help of European leaders. In addition to talking to Macron, he has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to visit Russia next weekend, with Iran atop the agenda.
Putin can’t, however, discount the possibility of a full-scale war between the U.S. and Iran, a war the Iranian regime cannot win. In such a situation, Putin would need a replacement for the Axis of Resistance in Syria — some sort of arrangement that would make it unnecessary for him to commit more troops but prevent U.S.-friendly regime change, thus allowing Russia to maintain its military bases.
Putin’s options for such an arrangement are currently limited to working with Turkey, the only other strong player in the region that isn’t a firm U.S. ally. On Wednesday, Putin will visit Ankara to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They will have more urgent things to discuss than the launch of a new natural gas pipeline. Though Russia and Turkey have weighed in on opposite sides of the civil conflict in Libya, Putin and Erdogan have a proven ability to work together. Last year, the two cooperated when Erdogan launched a military operation against the Syria-based Kurds.
That Erdogan is Putin’s only possible Plan B doesn’t augur well for Assad. The Turkish president would prefer him gone, and if Iranian support ceases, Putin is more likely to seek a compromise with Erdogan than to keep propping up Assad. The Syrian ruler, ironically, must be praying fervently that the Iranians do nothing rash."
liberal,"Brace for the Unintended Consequences of Killing Soleimani
“The law of unintended consequences is the only real law of history.” So says my good friend, the distinguished historian Niall Ferguson. We are seeing the wisdom of that line playing out in the days since a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s most important military commander, Qassem Soleimani.
Certainly Soleimani was a dangerous, smart, determined enemy of the U.S. Taking his skills away from the Iranian regime is a tactical plus in the effort against Iranian aggression and Middle East terrorism. Indeed, Iran’s ability to respond to Soleimani’s killing is now handicapped — the best person to imagine, plan and oversee a revenge operation would have been Soleimani himself.
But this tactical success is not matched by an articulated strategic approach from the administration of President Donald Trump. Think of chess, a game the Persians refined: Trump has taken one of the opponent’s most powerful pieces off the board. Good. Yet there’s no reason to think he has a plan to ultimately defeat a clever opponent who still has many capable moves available.
And perhaps most concerningly, there are an increasing number of unintended consequences beginning to emerge — several of which could have a disproportionate impact on global events. So often, big doors can swing on small hinges. The effects of Soleimani’s death will ripple from Baghdad to Tel Aviv to Nairobi to South America.
Let’s start with Venezuela. Over the past couple of days, there has been an apparent inflection point as the corrupt regime of Nicolas Maduro has attempted to unseat the legally elected leader of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido. Maduro has used the typical heavy-handed techniques, including physically blocking Guaido and other anti-regime elected officials from the assembly, while supporting a regime puppet to lead it. Why is Maduro suddenly emboldened? In part, no doubt, because he knows the U.S. administration is focused on Iran, not watching events in Latin America closely. Unintended consequence.
How about East Africa? On Sunday morning, three Americans were killed in Kenya, the latest of a string of attacks against U.S. interests by the terrorist group al-Shabab. Members of the group, which is associated with al-Qaeda, stormed an air base shared by U.S. troops and Kenyan forces and damaged American aircraft in addition to killing one U.S. service member and two civilian contractors. Al-Shabab watches CNN like every other terrorist group, and is well aware that the “unblinking eye” of U.S. intelligence collection has of necessity shifted its gaze to Iran. Unintended consequence.
Then there is Israel, which faces an enormous threat from Iran’s Lebanese proxy force, Hezbollah, which has tens of thousands of surface-to-surface missiles directed against America’s closest friend in the region. While most Israelis are happy to see Soleimani dead, there is understandable concern about whether Iran will energize the Hezbollah missile force against Israel. The Israelis have many tools at their disposal to degrade that threat, but a massive rocket attack on Israel would change the strategic calculus of the Middle East significantly. Unintended consequence.
New drama unfolding in the Iraqi parliament will probably lead to the departure of the last 5,000 American troops from that very divided nation. At one time, of course, the U.S. had more than 180,000 troops in Iraq. The final tranche of military ground power is there primarily to destroy the Islamic State, but its secondary purpose is to be helpful in countering the strong Iranian influence in Iraq. One of the principal goals of Iran — and of Soleimani himself — was to ensure that the U.S. left the region generally, and especially that it depart Iraq. It will be ironic in the extreme if Soleimani’s death ends up ensuring his key goal: the U.S. finally exiting Iraq after so many years and so much blood and treasure lost, squandering its ability to shape events across the Middle East. Unintended consequence.
On Iraq’s western border, important operations against the Islamic State have been “paused.” Why? Because U.S. forces are taking defensive measures to keep people and assets safe against the inevitable Iranian response. This is prudent on the part of the Defense Department, of course, but it gives the terrorists a breather. And make no mistake, the embers of ISIS are still quite capable of flaring back up in both Iraq and Syria. Unintended consequence.
Finally, at the geostrategic level, there is the way the Soleimani assassination will be received in NATO. During my time as the alliance’s top military commander, it became clear to me that the center of gravity of the alliance is political cohesion. Now that consensus is weakening, as many of the member-states start questioning the legality of this action under international law. Germany has already suspended the rotation of its troops to Iraq, and the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission there — to train the Iraqi security forces — is paused and at risk. Unintended consequence.
The lesson is simple: Before the U.S. makes a tactical decision to conduct an operation, administration officials and military planners need to think through the larger strategy of the chess match, which will continue long after a feel-good moment of killing one bad man. Based on what information has been made public and my own experience, I support the administration’s decision to take out Soleimani. But the consequences, especially the unintended ones, are going to set back U.S. efforts in the Middle East and around the world. You can’t escape the law of history."
liberal,"War Crimes? That’s Not How to Deter Iran
Even assassinating military leaders is bad for America’s long-term interests.
On Sunday President Donald Trump raised the possibility of targeting Iranian cultural sites as part of the ongoing conflict with Iran. He has since received plenty of criticism, but rather than just piling on — though I too think it is a bad idea — I think it is worth looking at the broader calculus of how to choose an appropriate target for retaliation.
Under current circumstances the retaliatory options include targeted assassinations, strikes at military targets, escalating cyberattacks, escalating proxy wars, and now attacks on cultural sites. (Tough sanctions are already in place.)
One reason not to strike at cultural sites is that it puts the U.S. government in some very pernicious company. The Taliban destroyed historic Buddhist monuments in Afghanistan to help make the country more Islamic. Hitler wanted his generals to detonate Paris as they were retreating, though fortunately they refused to do so. Such policies are now considered to be war crimes.
A second reason is that the Iranian government itself has mixed feelings toward those cultural sites. Some remind Iranian citizens of their country’s pre-Islamic heritage, while others in their splendor stand as reminders that Iran, formerly Persia, was once one of the world’s great powers. That invites unfavorable comparisons to Iran’s current status. Destroying those sites would turn them from implied rebukes of the current Islamic Republic into symbols of it.
Maybe Trump’s threat to attack cultural sites was not meant literally, but rather as a brash reminder that his retaliatory actions will not be constrained by world opinion, international law or the views of American elites. If so, such a signal, to be effective, has to harm the Iranian regime. Trump’s message shows that he doesn’t understand the calculus of retaliation very well.
Assassinating a military leader by drone, by contrast, is something the U.S. can do but the Iranian government cannot, at least not easily or without provoking even greater retaliation. That makes such a policy an effective deterrent in the short run, as it hurts the actual decision maker, and indeed that is what Trump chose to do.
By mentioning cultural sites, he in essence has decided to follow a very strong signal of action with a much weaker signal of words. If you are a hawk, you should understand that Trump’s talk of cultural sites is weakening his core message that retaliation will be effective. It is usually better game theory to follow up a highly impactful action with relative silence, but silence never has been Trump’s strong suit.
To be clear, it remains to be seen whether the killing of Qassem Soleimani will be good policy. Perhaps Iran cannot or will not retaliate against Americans right now. In the longer run, however, such decisions normalize targeted assassinations as tools of foreign policy. Over time, effective drones will become more widely available, and Americans will become more likely as targets.
In fairness to Trump, it should be noted that Barack Obama escalated such drone assassinations in several countries to an unprecedented degree, often killing innocent bystanders in the process. The primary difference is that Trump chose a higher-value target, but the logic of drone assassinations — if you accept it — argues for going after higher-value targets. Thus I don’t find current criticisms of the strike very convincing. The better argument is simply that both Obama and Trump have opened up a Pandora’s Box that Americans will someday come to regret.
And what about the other options?
Attacking or bombing military targets is an old deterrence standby, but these days it doesn’t seem to send much of a signal. Did the U.S. missile strike on the Shayrat airbase in Syria in 2017 have much of an impact?
Cyberattacks have been used to limit the Iranian nuclear program, and perhaps in other instances. But they don’t deliver an obvious public message. At any rate, cyberattacks don’t seem like the appropriate response in this case, given that Iran appears to have attacked the Saudi oil fields in September and was behind last week’s storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, both highly visible events.
Escalating proxy wars might be another option. But doing so would play into the hands of the Iranian government, which cares about those conflicts more than the U.S. does.
And so on the spectrum of possible responses, assassinating military leaders emerges as the best idea, relatively speaking, with targeting cultural sites as the worst. But the deeper question is how America got itself into a situation where the best retaliatory idea is still pretty bad, especially in the longer run. The point of retaliation is to protect your long-term interests. If effective retaliation is now a short-term tool, then U.S. foreign policy is in very bad shape indeed."
liberal,"This Is No Time to Snub Iran’s Foreign Minister
Last summer, when the Trump administration threatened sanctions on Javad Zarif, I argued that this placed too much importance on the Iranian foreign minister. He is, after all, a mere cipher in the Islamic Republic, a glorified spokesman for a regime where real authority is wielded by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Now that there’s a small chance of Zarif gaining an ounce of political weight in Tehran, it is doubly foolish of the U.S. to deny him a visa to attend a meeting Thursday of the United Nations Security Council. And that’s quite apart from the fact that such a ban runs contrary to the UN headquarters agreement of 1947, which requires the U.S. to allow foreign diplomats to visit the multilateral body.
A little background: Although Zarif has been the titular head of the foreign ministry since 2013, he has had little real power in setting policy. He was appointed to the post for the same reason Khamenei allowed Hassan Rouhani to win the presidential election that year: as window-dressing for a regime seeking to make a deal with the West.
Like Rouhani, Zarif had been Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator and had a reputation for charming Western interlocutors, in stark contrast to the dour, sour officials who characterized the administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Zarif had also been the Islamic Republic’s ambassador to the UN, where he was said to have developed useful friendships with influential Americans and an acute understanding of U.S. politics.
These qualifications made Rouhani and Zarif the perfect instruments for Khamenei’s top priority: to free Iran from the noose of international economic sanctions over its nuclear program. The two delivered on this with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
From that moment, Zarif’s utility to the supreme leader began to depreciate. Khamenei’s other foreign-policy priorities involved the expansion of Iran’s influence in its neighborhood, by destabilizing governments and promoting mayhem through terrorist groups and proxy militias. Zarif’s charm and credentials as a nuclear negotiator were of no value in this theater; this was a job for Khamenei’s main man in the Middle East, Qassem Soleimani.
Since May 2018, when President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the JCPOA and reinstated economic sanctions on Iran, Zarif’s role has been, in the main, to try to persuade the agreement’s European signatories to keep their end of the bargain. He was never going to succeed: Europeans fear Trump’s sanctions more than they covet business opportunities in Iran. 
The low point of Zarif’s career came early last year, during a visit to Tehran by the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The foreign minister was not even invited to a meeting with Khamenei’s favorite tyrant. Needless to say, Soleimani was. 
Zarif pouted and issued a faux resignation — on Instagram, of all places — but allowed himself to be persuaded to stay. His growing frustration manifested in his progressively more tetchy tweets. He has dropped his diplomatic pose in favor of snark, labeling the Trump administration as “the B-team” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “an arrogant clown.”
This playing to Khamenei’s prejudices — and to the peanut gallery in Tehran — helped preserve Zarif’s job, despite strong criticism from elements of the regime who regard him as a failure.   
Now, finally, things may be breaking his way. Soleimani’s death removes the main power player in foreign policy; his replacement as boss of the Quds Force, Esmail Ghaani, is at best an unknown quantity in that arena. Besides, Ghaani will have his hands full with the task of avenging the death of Khamenei’s favorite: If Iran does indeed have 13 retaliation scenarios, it’s a good bet that the majority of them will involve the Quds Force and the proxy groups that now fall under Ghaani’s authority. 
This might give Zarif some room to maneuver in foreign policy. And that room could expand if Khamenei decides to take the rational course and seek a detente with Iran’s neighbors and with the U.S. It would require Zarif to walk back some of his spiteful remarks and reprise his role as the regime’s charmer-in-chief, but this shouldn’t be difficult for a practiced chameleon.
That’s why it makes no sense for the Trump administration to bar him from the U.S. or the UN. Yes, there is an industrial quantity of hypocrisy in the idea of having the mouthpiece of a genocidal regime address the Security Council on the topic of upholding the UN Charter — which enjoins members, among other things, “to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.” But hypocrisy is the UN’s stock-in-trade: just run your eyes down the list of members of the Human Rights Council.
For the first time in years, Javad Zarif might actually matter: The Trump administration could not have picked a worse moment to make him a persona non grata."
liberal,"Is Iran a Rational Actor? We're About to Find Out
Khamenei's sole objective is to preserve his power. But he’s as likely to be informed by paranoia in his Soleimani response as he is by pragmatism.
Caveat emptor: Anybody who claims to know how Iran will respond to the killing of Qassem Soleimani is either a liar or a fool. The history of the Islamic Republic provides few meaningful pointers, because it has never been here before. None of its foreign enemies has taken out a figure of comparable importance to the Tehran regime.
No Iranian military commander of Soleimani’s standing was killed in the 1980-88 war with Iraq. The nuclear scientists assassinated — presumably by Israel — in the 2010s were important to the regime, but hardly as influential as the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ elite Quds Force.
The 1988 downing of Iran Air 655 by an American warship provoked similar outrage, but the military and political impact of Soleimani’s death exceeds even the collective weight of the 290 people killed on that aircraft. So it’s not safe to conclude that, because Iran never acted on solemn oaths of revenge then — “The criminal United States should know that the unlawfully shed blood in the disaster ... will be avenged in the same blood-spattered sky over the Persian Gulf” — that it will not do so now. 
Its response to Soleimani’s death-by-drone will answer a question that has attended every discussion about Iran since 1979: is the Islamic Republic a rational actor?
Plenty of smart people — including military men such as General Martin Dempsey, former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff — say it is. Other foreign-policy thinkers take the more nuanced view that Iran is rational without being reasonable: It has different priorities from those of its enemies, but its behavior is entirely logical in the context of those priorities.
My own view is that the regime has just one priority: its own perpetuation. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has demonstrated repeatedly in his three decades in charge that his sole objective is to preserve the peculiar form government that vests him with vast power over his people with little accountability. But his pursuit of that priority is as likely to be informed by ideology as it is by logic, as much by paranoia as it is by pragmatism. 
Consider the regime’s visceral hostility toward Israel, with which Iran has no borders and no history of conflict — and, indeed, a record of mutually beneficial cooperation until the Islamic Republic chose to make it a bogeyman. A pragmatic Khamenei would, at the very least, ignore Israel; only ideology, and an imagined enmity, prevents this.
Iran’s hostility toward its Arab neighbors has a stronger foundation. Many of them supported Saddam Hussein in the 1980-88 war. After that humiliation, the regime reckoned that positioning proxy militias within Arab states would prevent a reprise; this was dubbed Tehran’s “forward defence” policy. But Iraq’s decimation by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 removed the greatest menace to the Islamic Republic and gave Tehran the opportunity of a reset. That would certainly have been a rational call. Instead, Iran expanded its mischief both close to home (in Iraq and Syria) and far away (in Yemen).  
More generally, ideology makes Khamenei implacable toward the West, especially the Americans, even when a little pragmatic flexibility might benefit his regime. A rational Supreme Leader would see the long game in which Iran drops its nuclear, ballistic-missile and proxy-militia programs, re-enters the world economy, makes hundreds of billions from oil exports, and uses that to purchase the best military defense in the region — without loosening his own grip on power. Ideology blinds Khamenei to this.
Back to the here and now, a rational Khamenei would recognize that his promise of “severe retaliation” for Soleimani’s death can bring only more pain on Iran. War with the U.S. would impose a high cost on both sides, but the bill for Tehran would be many times bigger. 
Attacks by proxy, Iran’s preferred form of warfare, are no longer as safe as they were. President Donald Trump demonstrated with the killing of Soleimani that the fig-leaf of plausible deniability has fallen. Khamenei must now take on face value Trump’s threat of “disproportionate” retaliation for attacks on American targets.
Any strike on Israel would invite destruction not only on Iranian soil, but in Lebanon too, home of Iran’s strongest proxy. Netanyahu, his own political fortunes at a low ebb, is unlikely to avoid a confrontation with Iran. And he can be certain of full support from Trump.
Striking at targets among the Arab states such as Saudi Arabia would end the cautious efforts by those countries to arrive at a détente with Iran. And any attempt to choke off the Straits of Hormuz would hurt Iran’s allies — Iraq and Qatar — as well as cut off the Islamic Republic’s limited oil exports. 
The rational way forward for Khamenei is to stay the hand of his proxies and allow time to defuse the hysteria whipped up by Soleimani’s death. In the meantime, he would be able to continue improving relations with the Arab states — which, having peered over the edge, should be even more eager for parley. After an appropriate interregnum, he might use one or more of his Arab interlocutors to discreetly open a channel to the White House.
Of course, this would require the current occupant of that address to behave rationally, too. Trump’s threat to strike Iranian cultural sites makes it harder for Khamenei to do the smart thing. But it’s not certain he was ever going to. "
liberal,"China’s Next Crisis Brews in Taiwan’s Upcoming Election
As Hong Kong seethes, the island’s pro-independence camp is gaining strength.
As seats of state power go, Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan is jarringly humble. The parliament building, erected a century ago as an all-girls high school, occupies a rectangle of low-rise buildings in the center of Taipei, set back from the street behind a low fence. It was renovated only lightly for its current use: Aides work in what were once classrooms, and the former principal’s office now belongs to the parliamentary speaker. There are far too few offices for all 113 members, so many work out of even more utilitarian buildings nearby.
Taiwan is hardly a modest polity. Its population of approximately 23 million is roughly equal to Australia’s, and, with almost $600 billion in gross domestic product, its economy is comparable to Argentina’s. Neither of those countries, though, had a foundational figure quite like Chiang Kai-shek, who reigned as a virtual dictator from 1949 until his death in 1975. The Generalissimo, as he was often called, arrived on the island once known as Formosa under duress, thrust from China after Communist armies led by Mao Zedong defeated the forces of Chiang’s Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. The civil war never officially ended, and for the rest of his life Chiang considered the Taiwanese state—which is still officially known as the Republic of China—to be a government in exile, waiting for the inevitable day it would reconquer the mainland. There was no point in building anything grand for Taiwan’s legislators: That could wait for Chiang’s triumphant return to Nanjing, the Nationalist capital.
Much has changed in Taiwan since Chiang’s day, but this liminal quality has never really gone away. By almost any functional standard, it’s a sovereign country, with a president, a military, a central bank, passports, and all the other trappings of a state. But almost nobody who matters in international politics officially recognizes it as one. Taiwan isn’t a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, or the World Bank. Its formal diplomatic relations are mostly limited to a smattering of microstates in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Even the U.S., its primary ally, has no embassy in Taipei, instead funding an arm’s-length American Institute that happens to issue visas and employ Marines.
Taiwanese Views of Cross-Strait Relations
Data: Mainland Affairs Council, Republic of China
While this arrangement is undoubtedly awkward, it’s served Taiwan well. By treading carefully on the subject of formal independence, the island has been able to develop deep economic ties with the mainland—which officially considers it a rogue territory—and turn China into by far its largest trading partner. At the same time, Taiwan has maintained close business, political, and military relations with the U.S., which serves as the ultimate, if only semiformal, guarantor of its autonomy. With one foot in each of the world’s biggest economies, local companies such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the manufacturer better known as Foxconn, essentially built the modern technology supply chain, setting up the factory networks in China that made devices like the iPhone possible. Along the way, these companies helped Taiwan become one of Asia’s most sophisticated societies: high-tech, prosperous, and, since Chiang’s Kuomintang (KMT) relinquished its monopoly on power in the 1990s, raucously democratic.
Yet as Taiwan prepares for elections on Jan. 11 that will pit the pro-independence incumbent, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), against Han Kuo-yu, a China-friendly populist representing the KMT (which, improbably, has aligned itself with China in recent years), this model is under unprecedented strain. In Beijing, President Xi Jinping has signaled impatience with Taiwan’s unwillingness to accept Chinese rule, stepping up efforts to isolate the island from international institutions and suggesting it could be forcibly integrated. In Washington, meanwhile, the Trump administration has been working to sever China’s technology industry from the rest of the world, with a set of policies that represents an enormous challenge to Taiwan and could upend the business model that underpins its economy.
“The situation has changed. … Taiwan has to choose a side”
The campaign was unusually bitter even before the violence surrounding pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong escalated in the fall, riveting many Taiwanese and becoming a central election issue. The Chinese government openly reviles Tsai, who’s been targeted by online trolling and disinformation campaigns her government blames largely on Beijing. Her supporters accuse Han of harboring dangerous sympathies for China and being willing to sacrifice Taiwan’s de facto independence in exchange for economic gains. In November, Han’s campaign had to deny allegations, made by a Chinese defector to Australia who claims to be a former spy, that Han had received millions of dollars from the Communist government for a previous political campaign.
Voters now have an unusually stark choice to make—one reflecting the broader national dilemma as Chinese pressure intensifies. “I think many people in Taiwan realize the situation has changed,” says Jou Yi-cheng, a Taipei businessman and founder of a pro-independence political party. Eventually, he says, “Taiwan has to choose a side.”
Taiwan has been politically severed from the mainland for all but a few years since 1895, when the Qing dynasty, weakened by war and internal decay, was forced to cede it to Japan, which ruled it as a colony until the Second World War ended. Attitudes toward China remain the fundamental political cleavage. The DPP, which traces its roots to 1970s protests that opened the first cracks in one-party rule, is explicitly pro-independence and implicitly pro-Western; many of its senior officials were educated overseas and advocate closer ties to the U.S. and its allies.
Tsai was raised in Taipei by parents who ran an auto repair shop, attended law school at Cornell, and earned a doctorate at the London School of Economics. She worked as a trade negotiator for KMT governments early in her career, then joined the DPP in 2004 and was elected to parliament during the administration of Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP president of Taiwan. She first ran for the top job in 2012, losing narrowly to the KMT incumbent, Ma Ying-jeou. (Tsai declined to be interviewed for this story.)
The DPP gained new energy over the next several years, in particular from the Sunflower Movement, a student-led 2014 campaign to halt a proposed trade pact with China. Tsai won the presidential election two years later in a landslide, thanks in large part to support from young voters, who polls indicate are much more likely to identify as Taiwanese than Chinese. She also delivered the DPP’s first-ever majority in the parallel parliamentary election, and the party used its control of domestic lawmaking to implement a series of progressive policies—passing legislation, for instance, that made Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.
Even the most passionate DPP leaders act cautiously in their dealings with China, however, and Tsai has sought to avoid outright confrontation. Beijing has nonetheless refused official communications with her government and condemned her policies, which also include diversifying Taiwan’s economic relationships and building up its military. Last January, Xi took the podium at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, to signal a hard line on Taiwan, declaring that “China must and will be united” and that the task “cannot be passed from generation to generation.” As to how this might occur, he said that while “Chinese will not fight Chinese,” the government would “make no promise to abandon the use of force” to stop what it deems separatism. A few months later, People’s Liberation Army fighter jets crossed the midpoint of the Taiwan Strait for the first time in years, an especially provocative move in a series of military maneuvers there. Next, China placed restrictions on tourism from the mainland, drastically curtailing an important flow of visitors.
Tsai refused to change course, writing in Foreign Policy that “the people of Taiwan have not given in to the fearmongering of authoritarian regimes and never will.” She soon made a high-profile trip to the U.S.—technically a long layover on the way to see formal allies in the Caribbean, since Washington tightly restricts official visits by Taiwanese leaders. Not long after, the Trump administration signed off on one of her main defense initiatives, an $8 billion deal for advanced F-16 jets, over furious Chinese objections.
The KMT’s relationship with China is more complex. At the core of its philosophy is an informal compromise with Beijing that it calls the 1992 Consensus, which, unhelpfully, is neither from 1992—the name first came into use much later—nor really a consensus. It stipulates that Taiwan is part of China but doesn’t specify what “China” means, allowing each side to retain its own definition. This ambiguity is critical to the internal semiotics of the KMT, which has never renounced its claim to being the legitimate government of China even as its prospects of assuming power have grown remote, to say the least.
In practice, the party long ago made peace with its erstwhile Communist enemies. Its hostility to China’s rulers began to ease in the 1980s, and its leaders now espouse a policy of nonconfrontation, prioritizing cross-strait economic exchanges over political issues and laying the groundwork, however gradually, for unification. The strategy has yielded important results. Ma, who led Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, finalized a landmark deal to allow regular commercial flights to the mainland for the first time since the 1940s and also reached a broad economic agreement with Beijing. Not surprisingly, the KMT enjoys the support of many powerful businesspeople, whose investments in Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions depend on a reasonably stable relationship.
One of the most prominent advocates of this business-driven attitude is Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn and Taiwan’s second-richest man. A longtime KMT backer with strong networks in the U.S. and China, Gou announced in April that he would seek the party’s presidential nomination, citing as his priorities “peace, stability, economy, and future”—a list critics were quick to note omitted democracy or human rights.
It turned out, however, that KMT’s voters weren’t looking for factory-friendly pragmatism. Han defeated Gou easily in the primary, presenting his presidential run as Taiwan’s last chance to avoid a calamitous rupture in relations with Beijing. “The election is a choice between a peaceful Taiwan Strait or a Taiwan Strait filled with crisis,” he said in accepting the nomination. At stake was nothing less than “the life or death of the Republic of China.”
A few years ago, Han, a former member of parliament from a military family, was running an obscure government agency, the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corp., which acts as a wholesaler for farmers. In 2017 the KMT approached him to see if he’d be willing to run for mayor in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s third-largest city. A number of more plausible candidates had passed on the chance: Kaohsiung is the DPP’s heartland, and the campaign looked doomed.
But to the astonishment of almost everyone, Han won, leveraging a knack for baby-kissing retail politics and resentment over a local economic slump. The political elite in Taipei still had trouble taking him seriously. At one point, Tsai’s spokesman referred to Han as a tubaozi—a slur for a country yokel that translates literally as “dirt meat bun.” Han responded by holding a competition to find Kaohsiung’s best meat buns. He officially entered the presidential race in June, after a long period of informal campaigning that included a Taipei rally attended by tens of thousands. (He remains mayor of Kaohsiung.)
Han has an angular jaw, a thickly muscled neck, and a bald bullet of a head. He’s more polished than he once was—as a young lawmaker engaged in one of the Taiwanese parliament’s notoriously rowdy debates, he punched the DPP’s Chen so hard that the future president had to be hospitalized—but he retains a rumpled air. For an interview in November, he wore a mismatched blue blazer and ill-fitting black trousers over leather shoes that resembled slippers. A baseball fan, he opened with a joke about the Taiwanese team, which was vying to finish a tournament ahead of South Korea—Han-kuo in Mandarin. “I’m Han Kuo-yu,” he said, punning on his full name. “I hope Korea loses.”
He turned quickly to more serious matters. One of Han’s core beliefs is that Taiwan is an inextricable part of Chinese civilization, and he argues that it forgets this historical relationship at great peril to its economy and security. “There has been a calculated decrease in the connection our young people feel toward Chinese culture,” he complained, partly blaming textbook changes that emphasize the island’s distinct history. “Cutting off these connections to China does a great deal of damage.” In an odd extended metaphor, he likened Taiwan’s neighbor to the genie in the story of Aladdin, powerful and capable of delivering great riches. Compared with “the big genie,” he said, Taiwan “is very weak.”
Han was even more deferential to China before he became a presidential candidate, making comments suggesting, among other things, that independence was a prospect “scarier than syphilis.” In March he met with the head of the Liaison Office, which represents the Chinese central government in Hong Kong, as well as the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, the mainland body responsible for encouraging unification. It’s almost unheard of for a sitting Taiwanese politician to hold discussions with the Liaison Office, in particular, and some observers interpreted Han’s moves as a signal of openness to adopting Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” model, which permits limited autonomy under an umbrella of Beijing control. Such an outcome would please Xi, who in his January 2019 speech endorsed exactly that approach for Taiwan.
Events since have forced Han to explicitly reject the possibility. The Hong Kong protests, which began last spring in response to a bill before the territory’s legislature that would have allowed extradition to China proper, are one of the biggest topics in the Taiwanese campaign. During the interview, Han tried to straddle the debate, expressing concern about the potential loss of “economic power” in Hong Kong while urging Beijing to respect citizens’ desire for more say in their own affairs. “Many Hong Kong problems will be solved as long as true universal suffrage is implemented,” he said, referring to protesters’ demands to open up the city’s elections, which are held under a complex system dominated by government-friendly business lobbies. Free votes, he suggested, “will calm down Hong Kong people.”
The protests are clearly a more comfortable issue for Tsai, who presents them as evidence that Taiwan’s democratic values could never survive closer integration with China. They’re a big part of why most analysts view her as the clear front-runner, despite a slow start to her campaign. Such assessments don’t tell the whole story, however. A senior adviser to Tsai, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations, expressed concern about turnout, predicting that Han’s enthusiastic supporters will make it to the polls in large numbers. There’s also the matter of the legislative contest, in which the KMT stands a decent chance of regaining parliamentary power.
Han’s campaign has been fairly light on policy specifics. His economic proposals center on boosting Taiwan’s exports to China, along with establishing free-trade zones and creating a sovereign wealth fund. But he wants voters to be clear on one point: “Independence is the red line,” he said. “If the 23 million people of Taiwan came to a consensus and voted for independence in a referendum, they would have to deal with the military and political consequences.” In such a situation, “we don’t have any resources. We have nothing. All we have is talented people and a diligent fighting spirit.”
Rather, Han argued, Taiwan should seek to prolong the status quo for as long as possible. “I support the 1992 Consensus,” he said. “If you don’t agree with me, then don’t vote for me.”
For now, Tsai’s argument that Taiwan can thrive while distancing itself from China is being borne out. During a recent visit to Taoyuan, a city that’s home to many electronics manufacturers, a pair of bright-yellow excavators chipped away at an asphalt parking lot while workers directed a cement truck between stacks of foundation piles. They were building something Taoyuan hasn’t seen many of in the past few decades: a new factory, to be operated by Quanta Computer Inc., a Taiwanese company that makes hardware for Apple Inc. and others. After decades of rapid expansion in China, Quanta is reshoring production of some servers, pricey laptops, and additional premium products.
Although Tsai has sought to develop tourism, green energy, and other less established industries, the heart of her economic strategy is persuading Taiwanese tech companies to bring back production, especially of complex items for which China’s cost advantage is less of a factor. Her administration is helping manufacturers find space and providing cheap financing for advanced production facilities, promising, for example, to cover bank fees on more than $22 billion in loans. So far the effort seems to be paying off. The government says companies with overseas operations have promised almost $24 billion in domestic investment; in one recent example, Innolux Corp., a Foxconn affiliate, announced a $2.3 billion expansion of its Taiwanese production.
Some manufacturers haven’t needed much convincing, and not just because goods made in Taiwan aren’t subject to Trump administration tariffs targeting China. On Nov. 26 the U.S. Department of Commerce unveiled proposed rules that would allow it to block the import of any technology it deems a security risk, one of several measures designed to shrink China’s role in the technology supply chain. Although the agency said it planned to evaluate products on a case-by-case basis, it’s a safe bet that goods produced on the mainland will be subject to intense scrutiny. Nor have many Taiwanese companies’ experiences in China been unequivocally positive, particularly when it comes to protecting intellectual property. At home, says Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan, “they don’t have to worry that their technology will be stolen or pirated.” Other reasons for China’s declining appeal are more conventional. Rising wages and real estate prices have made it a much more expensive place to operate than in the past, and foreign producers now compete for workers with a large number of innovative local companies.
“In Hong Kong, universities have become battlefields. … That’s ‘one country, two systems’ for you”
Tsai’s government holds that Taiwan’s manufacturing expertise could let it become the hub of a restructured global technology industry, keeping advanced electronics flowing to the U.S. and Europe without much, if any, input from the traditional workshop to the world. “Before the trade war, the world had a centralized supply chain based in China,” says Kung Ming-hsin, a government minister responsible for future economic strategy. “But now it’s breaking up.” Taiwan, he argues, “can absorb these resources” if it moves fast. “We will only have three to four years to reshape our industries, and the outcome will decide our future for the next decade or two.”
It’s not clear, however, that this new strategic geography will be as kind to Taiwan’s economy as the old one. Taiwanese businesspeople were uniquely positioned to benefit from China’s economic opening, thanks to a common language, cultural similarities, and sometimes family ties—advantages they don’t enjoy in Vietnam or Cambodia, which are increasingly the destinations of choice for lower-end manufacturing.
There’s also the matter of Taiwan’s growing political isolation. In September the minuscule number of governments that recognize its sovereignty dropped to just 15, thanks to decisions by two Pacific island states, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, to switch their relations to Beijing. Taiwan has trade deals with fewer than a dozen countries, the bulk of them tiny economies in Central America. (Singapore and New Zealand are also on the list.) Tsai has sought to take Taiwan into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the recent trade pact that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico, but a successful campaign of Chinese pressure on any of its 11 signatories would make that impossible.
Taiwan does, however, still have its economic deal with the mainland, which many in the KMT would be delighted to expand. Doubling down on the cross-strait relationship and becoming a key player on the Chinese side of what could become a global economic cold war would in some ways be the path of least resistance, albeit one that could jeopardize relations with the U.S. It would also leave Taiwan exposed, even more than it already is, to a government in Beijing that will never accept a level of independence many Taiwanese view as fundamental.
In 2018 reports appeared in the island’s press about shipments destined for Chinese consumers being rejected by customs inspectors or pulled from shelves. The issue wasn’t that they were illegal or unsafe. Rather, the products were deemed unacceptable because their labels described them as “Made in Taiwan,” rather than the Communist Party’s preferred nomenclature: “Made in Taiwan, China.”
On a late-autumn afternoon in Kaoshiung, thousands of Tsai supporters streamed into an open field for a DPP rally. The party seemed intent on making a statement on Han’s home turf, busing in activists from other cities and bringing Tsai, Premier Su Tseng-chang, and a host of other notables onstage. Campaign staffers passed out little green flags with Tsai’s oddly prosaic campaign slogan, “Let’s Win,” written in English, while a rap crew warmed up the crowd and vendors dished out oyster omelets, pork dumplings, and huge skewers of deep-fried squid.
No one would accuse Tsai of possessing excessive charisma. She’s unassuming to a degree that can seem startling in a high-level politician, with a neat bob, ovoid glasses, and a strict uniform of black or gray blazers over light blouses. She delivers speeches in a near-monotone, as though delivering a trade-law lecture. But she sparks surprising ardor in her fans, some of whom mobbed her in search of selfies as she made the rounds of the food stalls. The reaction to her address, which began shortly after darkness fell, was similarly rapturous.
“Faced with pressure, our economy has to be strong, people have to feel confident in their ability to maintain their livelihoods, and our defense and diplomatic relations have to be maintained,” she said from the podium, waving her right hand up and down for emphasis. “We don’t aim to conquer the universe. Taiwanese people just want to use their own power to protect sovereignty and safeguard democracy.” The danger to both, she argued, is evident in Hong Kong. “China is promoting a Taiwan version of the ‘one country, two systems’ policy. But now in Hong Kong, universities have become battlefields, some people have suddenly gone missing, some people have died.” She continued: “That’s ‘one country, two systems’ for you. Can you accept that? Can you accept that? We will state very clearly: We will never, ever accept that.”
Even if Tsai wins a second term, there’s little chance she’ll end Taiwan’s 70-year political limbo. But for many of her supporters, especially the young, the argument over the island’s identity is already settled. That was the case for Sunny Lin, a 26-year-old auto parts worker who drove an hour to the rally. “It will take time to reach formal status, but we need to at least try,” she said, standing on the edge of the crowd. “We will never belong to China. For me, Taiwan has been a country for a long time.” "
liberal,"Eight Ways Wine Will Change in 2020
The 2010s saw the rise of serious global concern (at last!) about the effect of climate change on wine. That will continue big time, especially with 2019’s scorching heat waves in France and catastrophic fires in Sonoma, Calif., and South Australia.
ADVERTISING
The rosé juggernaut of the past decade continues, as luxury players move in to Provence. LVMH acquired two rosé producers last year, including a majority share of Château d’Esclans, maker of ubiquitous Whispering Angel. Chanel, owner of three Bordeaux châteaux, snapped up Domaine de l’Ile.
Natural wine captured the zeitgeist of the decade, which ended with trade wars slamming wine in the form of U.S. tariffs on French, German, and Spanish reds and whites, with the uncertainty of more to come in 2020. Brexit is still a problem, and wine caves, once a major tourism attraction in Napa, Calif., turned into political footballs. (Tip for cave owners: Don’t turn on the chandelier.)
Hard seltzer also captured hearts, minds, and tongues this past year, with sales surging 210% in the U.S. To my dismay, they’re poised to triple by 2023, according to the drinks market analysts at IWSR. Why not make wine spritzers?
On the plus side, fizz continues to effervesce, even though the French are drinking much less Champagne. To supply ever-increasing global demand (and at lower prices), Brazil, California, New Zealand, Oregon, and Tasmania are producing better sparklers than ever.
At least, unlike the roaring ’20s of a century ago, 2020 won’t begin with Prohibition.
Here’s what else I see in my crystal glass for 2020:
Global warming will ramp up wine experiments everywhere
You’ll see the bottled results of dozens of experiments, and more will be started. Sparkling wine from Nova Scotia? Definitely. Historic and new hybrid grapes that can cope with heat better? Spain’s Torres winery is on it; ditto Bordeaux, Champagne, and Napa. Fresher, brighter whites from high-altitude vineyards? Look to Chile and Argentina, including even the cold extremities of Patagonia.
Unfussy piquette will become a thing
Casual, low-cost, and low-alcohol drinks that offer gluggable simplicity are having a moment, and they’ll be even more important in 2020.
The fashion for pét-nats (pétillant naturel wines) and even hard seltzer (ugh!) are part of this trend. The latest addition is piquette, a worker’s drink popular centuries ago. Not technically a wine, it’s made by fermenting pomace—the leftover skins, seeds, and stems of grapes—to create a drink that’s 4% to 9% in alcohol with light bubbles to perk it up. It’s zippy and refreshing, akin to a sour beer. Wild Arc Farm in the Hudson Valley released four in 2019, including one in cans.
The past decade has seen wineries experiment with aging their wines under the sea. For 2020 and beyond, they’ll look to space.
This past November, Luxembourg-based Space Cargo Unlimited started a project that sent bottles of red wine to the International Space Station to be aged for 12 months. The idea is to investigate how exposure to more radiation and microgravity affect the evolution of a wine’s components. When the wine returns, the University of Bordeaux will analyze it and compare it with wines aged on Earth.
The no- and low-alcohol movement will gain a foothold 
The health and wellness craze will affect wine beyond the idea of “Dry January.” Cutting back on how much you imbibe will be one of the biggest drinks trends of 2020, according to London-based retailer Bibendum. Alcohol-free Real Kombucha, introduced in 2017, is now available at more than 50 Michelin-starred restaurants and touted as an alternative to sauvignon blanc.
Expect a boost of interest in organic and biodynamic wines—“health-focused” wine club Dry Farm Wines claims its offerings are all-natural and lab-tested for purity—as well as those naturally low in alcohol, such as riesling, lightly fizzy Spanish txakoli, and slightly sweet Italian moscato d’Asti. All are far more delicious and just as healthy as wines from “clean wine” companies such as FitVine. 
Insert token, receive a small bottle of Moët & Chandon brut or rosé. What could be simpler? Nabbing a bottle at a test machine in the Ritz-Carlton in Naples, Fla., was cheaper, more convenient, and more fun than waiting for room service. New York got its first machine in October, and in 2020 Moët plans to spread 100 of them across the U.S. (You can even buy your own—$35,000 at Neiman Marcus—but stocking it with 360 mini-bottles costs extra.)
The machines reflect the growing demand for instant access, even for luxury wines. Expect other wine companies to jump on this bandwagon. But because of France’s alcohol laws, don’t look for one in Paris.
For starters, a €100 million ($112 million) World of Wine project is opening in 2020 across the Douro River from the city of Porto. The Fladgate Partnership, owner of several top port houses, is transforming 300-year-old warehouses into a series of wine experiences including a wine school and cork museum.
In France, Champagne Bollinger is opening its doors to the public via membership in its special Club 1829, Château Lafite Rothschild will open a new hospitality center and wine school at Château Duhart-Milon in time for harvest, and Burgundy breaks ground this month on its own Cité des Vins.
But the most interesting new wine travel development is the global DIY winemaking timeshare the Vines Global. Membership will let aspiring vineyard owners test their mettle making wine in a dozen regions with top winemakers. It started in Tuscany’s Montalcino last September; next year it will add Priorat, Spain, and two other places, with more to come.
Just want to see vineyards? The World’s Best Vineyards, a new annual ranking of the 50 most amazing ones to visit, will help you know where to go.
Wine packaging will surprise you
No longer a fad, canned wines are expected to reach sales of $4.6 billion by 2024. Now that canning has been normalized, and higher-quality wines skip the traditional glass bottle, keep a lookout for ever more innovative packaging: refillable, reusable jugs and flat bottles made from recycled plastic, as well as green-friendly components such as zero-carbon corks.
As for the staid wine label, more than 500 wineries across the globe are turning to augmented reality to bring labels to life through apps. And in Washington state, Chateau Ste. Michelle’s new Elicit Wine Project will act as an innovation hub for brands to take an info-rich, creative look at names, labels, and bottle design; for instance, its Fruit & Flower brand comes in both cans and bottles with themed label images to mirror the flavors of the wine inside.
Wine shops will become less conventional
U.K. department store John Lewis has added bookable wine master classes. Stranger Wines in Brooklyn, N.Y., plays vintage vinyl records and is expanding to snacks, and Manhattan’s just-opened Peoples is a wine bar that doubles as a retail wine shop, even if they have to have separate entrances because of liquor laws.
Nielsen predicts AR and virtual reality technology will transform wine shops with navigation apps and electronic shelf beacons. The future will surely bring artificial intelligence-powered robot assistants. At the same time, buying online via phone apps will soar, again helped along by new technology.
But as the year progresses, I still have plenty of questions. Will wine lovers continue to lust after the wines LeBron James posts on Instagram? Will interactive wine lists on tablets take over in Michelin-starred restaurants? Will South Africa be the value region of the year? I’ll be watching and reporting on these stories and many more in 2020."
liberal,"Voters in Asia’s Brightest ‘Tiger’ Economy Face a Tricky Choice

Taiwan’s economic performance could act as a tiebreaker for undecided voters choosing a candidate in this weekend’s election, with the recent successes during President Tsai Ing-wen’s term offset by frustration at slower-than-expected progress in boosting the incomes of ordinary citizens.
While Tsai has overseen faster growth, a surge in investment and buoyant financial markets since she took office in 2016, there are concerns hidden under the rosy data. Here are four charts summarizing the outlook as she faces the challenge from Han Kuo-yu of the more China-friendly Kuomintang, and James Soong of People First Party this Saturday.
Taiwan has emerged as a surprise winner of the U.S.-China trade war, as the economy benefits from re-shoring of investment by companies previously embedded in China. Full year output growth for 2019 is set to come in at 2.5%, according to the median of economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mean Taiwan tops the four “Asian Tiger” economies for the first time since 2014.
The island’s income-per-person level remains a long-standing challenge. While Tsai has overseen the fastest income growth in 20 years, it is still the lowest of the four, which has fueled criticism of Tsai from her challenger Han Kuo-yu.
Taiwan’s income level is expected to have risen to $24,828 as of the end of 2019, lower than South Korea’s $31,431, Hong Kong’s $49,334, and Singapore’s $63,987, according to International Monetary Fund data. Taiwan’s income per capita has only grown 67% from end-2000 to 2019, compared with 93% for Hong Kong, 156% for South Korea, and 168% for Singapore over the same period.
While concrete proposals remain scarce, Han has promised to increase exports of agricultural products, boost tourists from China, and to establish free economic zones as part of his plan to bolster the economy.
Taiwan’s job market has been stable. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.97% before President Tsai took office in 2016 and has trended lower afterward, reaching a record low of 3.69% twice. Its November reading was steady at 3.73%.
The lower jobless rate may be partly due to fewer job seekers in the market, as postwar baby-boomers are retiring and Taiwan grapples with an aging society. Taiwan may see a declining population as soon as 2022, according to an estimate from the island’s National Development Council. That’s three years earlier than its previous estimate.
Strong Inflow
Reshoring of investment is seen continuing this year
Source: Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs
Tsai’s most prominent achievement could be the policies to boost investment. Local firms have been encouraged to invest at home, as the U.S.-China trade war accelerates manufacturing relocation and helps Taiwan retake a slice of the global technology supply chain.
Over NT$700 billion of investment has been approved as of January 3 from the re-shoring program, according to government data.
Investment in place is estimated to reach NT$225.5 billion at end-2019, NT$213.3 billion in 2020, and NT$183.1 billion in 2021, according to estimates from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. It means investment momentum will continue this and next year, though lower than the peak in 2019.
Foreign firms such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. and wind power company Orsted A/S have also recently won government approval to invest in local projects."
liberal,"U.S. Suspects Iran Reprisal Deliberately Missed American Troops
Iran apparently intended to avoid U.S. casualties when it launched more than a dozen missiles at U.S.-Iraqi airbases in retaliation for an American airstrike that killed a top Iranian general, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.
U.S. assessments of the strikes indicate Iran may have been aiming at unpopulated areas of the sprawling Al Asad airbase, because precision guided missiles struck sandy areas, said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information wasn’t yet publicly announced. The absence of U.S. casualties could mitigate the potential for a dramatic escalation.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility for the barrage, which the Pentagon said was launched from Iran, and warned that additional operations were being prepared. At the same time, there were signs that both sides wanted to pull back from the brink of conflict, with Iran’s foreign minister saying his country didn’t wish to go to war, and Trump pronouncing that “All is well.”
The Pentagon said that Al Asad and the base near Erbil that were struck had already been on high alert, and Iraq said it had received prior warning from Iran of an assault. No U.S. or Iraqi casualties were reported.
Stocks dropped and oil rose, though crude later pared gains on the reassuring signals. Major tanker companies, however, including Petrobas Brasileiro SA and the National Shipping Co. of Saudi Arabia, suspended sailing through the Straits of Hormuz, a major oil waterway, Dow Jones reported.
Some sort of response had been expected to the killing last week of Qassem Soleimani, who ran Iran’s proxy operations across the Middle East and was killed in a drone strike near the airport in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. While Tehran doesn’t want outright war with the U.S., there was growing pressure at home to react. The balancing act was to do so without tipping things into a conflict that no one has appetite for.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the attacks on the bases as a “crushing response.”
“Last night, they got a slap in the face,” he said on state television. He again demanded that the U.S. presence in the region come to an end, a sign that Tehran’s ultimate goal remains to push the U.S. military out of Iraq.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sounded more conciliatory. The government “concluded proportionate measures in self-defense” after the Soleimani strike, he said on Twitter. “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.”
Iran has for years operated a carefully calibrated strategy of attacks, often via proxies, in the Middle East, that preserves its influence without drawing major retaliation. Crippled by economic sanctions, it can ill afford an outright war.
Iran “needed to do something quick,” said Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Center for Global Policy in Washington. “This is a placeholder move and a low-cost one.”
One White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the early thinking was the missile strike was a perfunctory move that would let Iran retaliate without incurring a potentially devastating U.S. counter-assault. Trump is scheduled to make a statement later Wednesday.
Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have soared under Trump, who walked away from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, approved by his predecessor. Since then, Iran has retreated from limitations on its nuclear program.
Iran’s attack sent futures on the S&P 500 Index down as much as 1.7% before paring losses. Gold initially advanced to the highest since 2013, though those gains were trimmed along with an advance in oil, which at one point surged above $65 a barrel.
The Iraqi prime minister’s office said it received verbal notice from Iran before the strike. It said 22 missiles entered Iraqi airspace early Wednesday, and 17 hit Ayn al-Asad, a key U.S. facility in the country that’s been visited by both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
The tensions disrupted flights, with U.S. aviation regulators issuing new restrictions barring civilian traffic over Iraq, Iran, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Adding to the turmoil, a Boeing Co. 737 passenger jet bound for Ukraine crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran, killing all 176 people on board, with Iran’s media reporting it was due to a technical problem.
World leaders urged restraint, and Turkey indicated it’s willing to mediate between the U.S. and Iran. Ankara has cordial relations with eastern neighbor Iran, and enjoys warm ties with Trump, despite severe strains with Congress over a Russian missile purchase.
Trump has shown restraint in previous attacks in the region blamed on Iran that didn’t kill any U.S. citizens. But Iran’s quick claim of responsibility and the targeting of U.S. military outposts make some sort of retaliation more likely.
“The next question is, does the U.S. react or overreact to this,” said Jarrett Blanc, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation.
Iran is believed to have the region’s largest stockpile of short-range ballistic missiles, and a large number of American military and diplomatic facilities in the region were seen as potential targets for reprisals. Another option is Iranian proxies.
“As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the region,” according to a Pentagon statement.
The U.S. had vowed a quick and overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks and over the past week deployed about 3,500 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne to Kuwait and three Navy ships with about 2,200 Marines to the Persian Gulf region.
Drone Strike
Tensions between the U.S. and Iran soared following a Dec. 27 rocket assault on an Iraqi base that killed an American contractor. The U.S. blamed Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia closely associated with Iran.
On Dec. 29, U.S. aircraft struck five bases in Iraq and Syria used by Kataib Hezbollah. Two days later, dozens of Iraqi militiamen and their supporters stormed the U.S. embassy complex in Baghdad. The U.S. responded with the drone strike on Soleimani."
liberal,"Red Flags Emerge With Record-High Stocks Brushing Aside Political Turmoil
President Donald Trump toned down rhetoric against Iran, fueling a rally in American stocks that took major benchmarks to fresh records.
The rebound from an overnight rout that topped 1.5% has some investors breathing a sigh of relief, but another cohort point to mounting signs that the comeback is a sign of complacency among bulls.
“This is a market looking through fundamental data, looking through corporate guidance and data points, looking through Fed guidance itself,” Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told Bloomberg Television. “It is a market that wants to go up in the short term. That is what makes it so profoundly dangerous.”
Who Needs Hedging?
As the world awaited Iran’s response to Friday’s U.S. killing of a top general, equity traders showed little inclination to hedge against losses. The cost of a bearish put option versus that of a call continued to slide, recently touching levels that have been rare throughout the bull market, Cboe data show.
Breadth Surge
The latest surge has taken 82% of S&P 500 firms above their average price for the past 200 days, the highest percentage in two years. Such strong market breadth, where gains are not concentrated in a few heavyweights, is generally a sign that a rally has room to run. But Frank Cappelleri, a senior equity trader and market technician at Instinet in New York, says the current reading is a “frothy indicator we need to watch.”
According to Cappelleri, the last time so many firms topped the key level, the benchmark fell into a correction not long after. “Eventually, many stocks will slip back below their long-term moving averages -- like they always do,” Cappelleri wrote to clients Wednesday.
Shorts Evaporate
After last year’s historic run, investors continue to expect further gains. Short sales in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, known by its ticker SPY, as a percentage of shares outstanding fell to 1.1% Tuesday, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s the lowest level since January 2018, before the event known as “Volmageddon” sent stocks swooning.
Leveraged Love
Exchange-traded fund investors are going all in, rushing for some of the riskiest products out there that bet stocks will keep on rising. Jason Goepfert, the president of Sundial Capital Research, tracks assets in popular leveraged long products (ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF and ProShares Ultra QQQ, for example) compared to their counterparts that bet on a decline. Over the past month, assets in leveraged long ETFs have gained more than 15%, while the short products have lost more than 10%, his data show.
“This is another concern for stocks here, as leveraged traders have become far too comfortable,” Goepfert wrote to clients.
Technical Signs
One particular technical indicator is now flashing “sell.” The GTI Vera Convergence Divergence Indicator, which measures momentum shifts upwards and downwards, received a new bearish signal late last week, and warning continues to flash."
liberal,"NHTSA Probing Fatal Crash of Tesla and Fire Truck in Indiana
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will probe the Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Tesla Inc. vehicle that slammed into a parked fire truck on an Indiana highway, the agency said on Wednesday evening.
The fire truck had its emergency lights flashing while responding to an earlier crash and was parked across a left-hand lane on Interstate 70 roughly 45 miles west of Indianapolis when it was hit by the Tesla, the Indiana State Police said in a Dec. 29 statement.
The 23-year-old wife of the Tesla’s driver died of her injuries at a hospital, according to the statement. The 25-year-old driver was injured. No firefighters were hurt. 
The state police said they planned to reconstruct the crash, which occurred about 8 a.m., as part of their investigation, and that drugs and alcohol were not contributing factors.
NHTSA did not specify whether Tesla’s collection of automated driver-assist technologies known as Autopilot were active in the Indiana crash, but the investigation follows a series of inquiries opened into such crashes.
NHTSA has looked into 23 crashes in which some form of automated driver-assist technologies were believed to be in use at the time of the collisions. Of those, 14 of involved Tesla models, NHTSA said in its statement."
liberal,"TikTok Security Flaws May Have Exposed User Videos to Hackers
A cybersecurity firm has called attention to security holes in TikTok that would have allowed hackers to infiltrate the accounts among its billion-plus users, another black eye for a Chinese-owned social media phenom that’s drawn fire from U.S. lawmakers.
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. outlined in a report a series of vulnerabilities that cyber-attackers could exploit to manipulate user accounts and information, from revealing personal data and deleting videos to sending text messages on behalf of TikTok. The research firm said it informed TikTok -- owned by Chinese giant ByteDance Inc. -- which deployed fixes. TikTok confirmed the patches and said it was committed to protecting user data, and encouraged researchers to privately disclose flaws.
The revelations may intensify the scrutiny over a social media service that’s exploded in popularity globally in past years. ByteDance has emerged as the world’s most valuable startup thanks largely to the platform, where more than a billion, largely young, users share lip-syncing and dance videos. But with escalating tensions between China and the U.S., American politicians have warned the app represents a national security threat and urged an investigation. The Beijing-based company is weighing options to address those concerns.
“TikTok videos are entertaining. They’ve created a major trend, a style, even a musical genre,” Check Point researchers wrote in the report. “But as some have experienced, there is often a fine line between fun clips to private, even intimate assets being compromised while trusting to be under the protection from the apps we use.”"
liberal,"Voters Fail Mock Election, Exposing Vulnerability to Hackers
There’s a secret weapon in America’s battle to secure the 2020 vote from nation-state hackers: the voters. But there’s a problem. Only a few of them are in on the secret.
Many voters across the country will cast ballots this year on machines called ballot-marking devices, which attempt to marry the convenience of touchscreen technology with an auditable paper trail. To ensure that these BMDs accurately translate each voter’s choices from screen to paper, voters must verify summary receipts or ballot cards to identify errors, if they exist.
Yet only 6.6% of voters in a mock Michigan election discovered mistakes -- like a vote for a candidate they hadn’t selected -- that were deliberately introduced into the machines to mimic the work of a hacker. Only 40% of participants bothered to check the ballots without being prompted, according to a report published Wednesday by the University of Michigan called “Can Voters Detect Malicious Manipulation of Ballot Marking Devices.”
States and local jurisdictions across the country are embracing these voting machines, which proponents say provide a paper trail that catches computer errors -- or hacks -- before a winner is declared. South Carolina and Georgia -- accounting for about 9 million voters -- have adopted BMDs. So have several counties in Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles County, the largest election jurisdiction in the U.S.
The Michigan study determined that these largely unproven machines carry risks and vulnerabilities capable of undermining the integrity of elections in 2020. If any are infected with malware, the paper trail designed to verify results could be corrupted, allowing cheating in the election to go undetected, according to the report.
The study asked 241 eligible voters to cast ballots at a pair of Ann Arbor libraries on three BMDs over three days in July and September. Voters were told they were participating in a study to assess the “usability of a new type of voting machine,” according to the report.
The voters made their selections on the screens and printed their ballots before walking over to a scanner a few feet away. What they didn’t know was that their ballots included at least one intentional error and that surveyors were watching to see how many voters would check their ballots before formally submitting them.
When unprompted, more than 93% of voters didn’t catch a mistake despite checking the ballot, apparently putting their faith in the computer to protect their vote. In at least one case, voters who found mistakes blamed themselves instead of the machine.
“I don’t remember voting for the member of Congress and there was a vote” on the paper ballot, said one voter, according to the report. “I may have but just don’t remember.”
The study tried multiple techniques to remind voters, including signs in the polling place and verbal cues. The findings improved when poll workers prompted voters to check their ballots. For instance, every voter reviewed their ballot once informed that the paper records were the “official record” of their vote. But even then, only 38.5% of voters found the mistakes in their ballots, too low a rate to alert precinct workers of a system-wide problem requiring intervention, according to the report.
The report acknowledges that BMDs do have benefits. They are better than having no paper trail and assist voters with disabilities. But they also require further evaluation before being used as the primary method of voting, as will be the case in jurisdictions across the country in 2020, said J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan.
“Technology in voting is very popular; only a small number of voters understand the risk of hacking,” said Halderman, an author of the report. “I don’t think we’re too flawed as a species to execute democracy, but we need to use the tools that are available to us that ensure the credibility of our results. BMDs have not been proved to be safe and effective.”"
liberal,"Netflix Snubbed at Golden Globes as Gervais Skewers Hollywood
“1917,” a World War I epic from director Sam Mendes and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures, won the prize for best drama Sunday from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, inserting itself into an awards race just days ahead of its wide release in theaters. Mendes also took home the prize for best director.
That was bad news for Netflix Inc. “1917” beat out four other pictures, including three contenders from the streaming giant: “The Irishman,” “Marriage Story” and “The Two Popes.” Pundits had seen “The Irishman” as the frontrunner -- not just Sunday night but at the Academy Awards next month. But Netflix won just two prizes on the night, one for its TV show “The Crown” and another for “Marriage Story.”
The result is a scrambled race for the best-picture Oscar -- Hollywood’s most-coveted prize -- as nine different movies won awards out of the 14 Golden Globe categories, and no movie won more than three. Netflix fell as much as 1.4% in New York trading Monday.
If any film emerged as a frontrunner for the Oscars, it is Quentin Tarantino and Sony Corp.’s “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood,” which won the Golden Globe for best film comedy. Tarantino also won best screenplay for his ode to 1960s Hollywood, while Brad Pitt won best supporting actor for his performance as a stunt double to the film’s lead actor, Leonardo DiCaprio.
“Thank you to the eclectic and ever raucous Hollywood Foreign Press Association,” Pitt said in accepting his award.
The NBC telecast was hosted by comic actor Ricky Gervais, fronting the show for the fifth time. In his opening monologue, he skewered actors who use their acceptance speeches for political statements -- and the companies they work for.
“Well, you say you’re woke, but the companies you work for in China -- unbelievable. Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS started a streaming service you’d call your agent, wouldn’t you?”
The commentary struck a nerve on social media, with the hashtag #HollywoodHypocrites trending on Twitter Monday. But picking Gervais as host didn’t boost the ratings. NBC said on Monday the show was seen by 18.3 million viewers, down about 1.7% from a year earlier.
Foreign Journalists
While the Oscars reflect the tastes of the people who work in Hollywood, the Globes are decided by a few dozen international journalists. They have always shown a preference for big names, leading to surprise winners.“1917,” which opened in select theaters in December, will go into wide release Friday.
Winners in the big Golden Globe categories, best drama and best musical or comedy, have gone on to win best-picture Oscars five times over the past decade. Double winners include “Green Book,” “Moonlight,” and “Argo.”
And while the Golden Globes have never been the best predictor of Oscar glory, the top awards can extend a movie’s life at the box office, and a growing cadre of streaming services view them as a key way to bring in subscribers and attract talent for projects.
Netflix has chased awards with particular gusto, spending tens of millions of dollars on campaigns and angering competitors. Awards voters were at first reluctant to acknowledge Netflix, which has upended Hollywood’s economics.
Major theater chains refuse to show Netflix movies -- because they become available for streaming so soon -- and some major media companies have stopped selling their TV shows and films to the streaming giant.
Filmmaker Resistance
But resistance from filmmakers melted in the face of funding for their projects. A veritable who’s who of filmmakers, including Alfonso Cuaron, Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Ava DuVernay, has now made films for the company. The imprimatur of those lions of cinema has helped Netflix charm awards voters. The company received more Globes nominations than any other studio, and Cuaron won the Oscar for best director last year.
“No one cares about cinema and no one watches network TV,” Gervais said in his opening monologue. “Everyone’s watching Netflix.”
Everyone, that is, except members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Netflix’s lavish spending and plethora of nominees didn’t result in many victories.
Korean Victory
“Parasite” won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film, the first South Korean movie to ever win that prize in the event’s 77-year history. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, “Parasite” is a parable of class, family and privilege about a poor Korean family that insinuates itself into the lives of a wealthy family.
‘Parasite’ Is Awarded Top Foreign Film at Golden Globes
The film debuted in October to ecstatic reviews and was named the year’s best film by the National Society of Film Critics.
The win boosts the Oscar odds of “Parasite,” which has the third-best shot at winning best picture according to Gold Derby. Winning the top prize is always a challenge for a foreign film, and foreign movies can’t even be nominated for the best drama or comedy at the globes.
Unlike the Emmys and the Oscars, the Golden Globes honor both films and TV shows. HBO’s “Succession” was crowned best drama while Amazon.com Inc.’s “Fleabag” won best comedy.
AT&T Inc.’s HBO won the most awards of any network, scoring four between “Succession,” a drama about a family that controls a media empire, and “Chernobyl,” a miniseries about the disaster at a nuclear plant in the old Soviet Union.
Despite earning the most nominations of any network, Netflix only won one prize for TV shows. Apple Inc., a newcomer to the awards circuit, failed to win a statue in its first year competing at the Golden Globes.
The iPhone maker earned three nominations for “The Morning Show,” its drama set behind the scenes of a TV news program upended when one of the hosts is accused of sexual harassment.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook attended the program, and was almost immediately subjected to a barb from Gervais, who last hosted the show in 2016.
“Apple roared into the TV game with ‘The Morning Show,’ a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China,” he quipped.
Facebook Inc. also took a shot, from comic actor Sacha Baron Cohen, who was introducing the film “Jojo Rabbit,” a satire about a young German boy who finds out his mother his hiding a Jewish girl in the attic.
“The hero of this next movie is a naive, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends,” he said. “His name is Mark Zuckerberg. Sorry, this is an old intro for ‘Social Network.’”"
liberal,"JPMorgan Boosts Annual Fee on Chase Sapphire Reserve Card
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is boosting the annual fee for customers to $550 from $450 as it adds new perks with partners such as DoorDash and Lyft Inc., according to bank spokeswoman Ashley Dodd. For new cardholders, the increased annual fee will go into effect on Jan. 12, while existing customers will pay the new fee once their cards renew starting April 1.
The increase follows a move by rival American Express Co. in 2017, when the company raised the fee on its Platinum card to $550 after adding benefits like a $200 annual Uber credit to its bevy of benefits. The two firms have been battling for premium millennial customers since 2016, when JPMorgan debuted the Sapphire Reserve.
JPMorgan said Tuesday that it’s adding the perk of a year of lower DoorDash fees, and on Wednesday said it’ll give Sapphire Reserve customers $120 in statement credits for the food-delivery service. The bank also will partner with Lyft to offer Sapphire Reserve members a free year of Lyft Pink, a new monthly membership program from the ride-sharing app, as well as 10 points per dollar spent with the company, Dodd said.
The bank is trying to lure new customers by targeting services that are surging in popularity. JPMorgan said customers more than doubled their spending on food-delivery services in the past year, with the average person ordering in a least once a month. Most Sapphire Reserve customers use ride-hailing apps at least once a week, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing internal data.
Since JPMorgan introduced the luxury card, industry watchers have wondered how the bank could make money on it while still offering generous benefits like three points per dollar spent on dining and travel, which can be redeemed for more than one cent per point. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. estimated in 2016 that the bank wouldn’t break even on its investment in the card for more than five years.
Many of the world’s biggest card issuers have been scaling back perks and introductory offers in recent months as the industry begins to prepare for an eventual downturn in consumer credit. Last year, Citigroup Inc. discontinued free trip insurance and price-protection guarantees on its U.S. cards, and AmEx’s chief executive officer said last month that the war for premium consumers has begun to level off."
liberal,"Despite Trump’s Claim, the U.S. Still Needs Some Middle East Oil
President Donald Trump said during an address from the White House Wednesday that the U.S. no longer needs oil from the Middle East, but American refineries still use the kind of oil that region produces.
Thanks to booming shale production, the U.S. reduced shipments from the Persian Gulf to a 30-year low last year. Still, Middle East crude makes up more than 10% of U.S. imports. With new oil production records being set in the Permian Basin, the country’s energy growth engine, America’s thinning reliance on Middle East crude isn’t about to reverse course.
Before the “shale revolution,” as American drillers call it, Gulf coast refiners invested millions of dollars to process relatively cheap heavy oil from the Middle East and Latin America. At the same time, shale oil is much lighter and lower in sulfur compared with supply from the Persian Gulf, and not ideal for most American refineries.
Sources of heavy crude supplies have already been limited since the U.S. levied sanctions on Venezuelan oil, declining Mexican production and Canadian logistical constraints. With sanctions already on Iran, buyers are still dependent on other Persian Gulf producers."
liberal,"Iran Won’t Be Satisfied by Iraq Missile Attacks
There’s a temptation to characterize the Iranian missile attacks on an Iraqi base on Tuesday night as a letting off of steam by the Islamic Republic — a shot across the American bow, after which the two sides can begin to parley. It’s being suggested that, if President Donald Trump restrains himself from tit-for-tat action, the tensions raised by the killing of Qassem Soleimani might begin to ease.
Color me skeptical. The regime in Tehran, having whipped itself into a hysteria over the assassination, is unlikely to satisfy itself with a mere volley of missiles; and the fact that no Americans were killed will do little to slake Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s bloodlust. 
More likely, the missiles mark the first salvo of what Khamenei has promised will be “severe retaliation” against the U.S. for taking out his favorite killing machine. Having encouraged millions of Iranians to come out into the streets to mourn Soleimani and demand vengeance, the Supreme Leader has painted himself into a corner. His description of last night’s strikes as “a slap in the face” of the U.S. will not fool his countrymen, and certainly not the families of the 56 killed in the stampede at Soleimani’s funeral.
Nor will it suffice for Iran’s proxy militias in Iraq, which have lost several leaders to American attacks in recent days, including Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces.
The most noteworthy aspect to the missile strikes is that they were unambiguously of Iranian provenance; unlike, say, the attacks on Saudi oil installations last September, there was no effort to obfuscate the origins of the missiles, nor to pretend they were shot off by proxy militias acting on their own initiative. Khamenei had already signaled that he wanted the response to Soleimani’s death to bear an Iranian signature, and he has been as good as his word.  
This doesn’t mean the next salvos will come from Iranian soil. Although Iranian militias were clearly under instruction to hold their fire while Tehran took the first shot, they’ve been itching to demonstrate their own fealty to Soleimani, and will now feel freer to act. This is especially true of the militias farther from the range of American counter-strikes: Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas in Gaza.
Nor has Khamenei forsworn the Islamic Republic’s traditional tactics: unclaimed attacks on international shipping; rocket strikes on U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia; the kidnapping of Westerners; cyber-warfare; and assassinations in Europe. The chances that Iran will use any of these measures is unchanged.
Some early reports suggest that the absence of casualties from last night’s barrage was no accident — that the Iranians warned the Iraqis of the incoming missiles, and the latter in turn warned the Americans. But this was, more than likely, a courtesy extended to what Tehran regards as a friendly government in Baghdad. If the next strikes on U.S. nationals or interests occur in countries hostile to Iran, such warnings may not be forthcoming.
Nor is it safe to assume that Trump will leave the Iranian attack unanswered. He tweeted that “all is well” after the missile strikes, but that was a reference to the absence of American casualties, and shouldn’t be read as a signal that he’s prepared to wind down hostilities. In ordering the killing of Soleimani, Trump indicated that he is willing to punish Iran directly, and disproportionately, for the actions of its proxies, so any attacks against Americans by an Iraqi militia could lead to blowback against Iranian targets.
Separately, the U.S. may not have ended its campaign of decapitating the leadership of Iranian proxies. Even if these kill no more high-value Iranians, Khamenei may feel obliged to respond.
Another interesting feature of Tuesday night’s missile barrage is that the Iranians showed not even a pretense of concern for Iraqi sovereignty. It suggests the Islamic Republic will no longer hold to its practice of using Arab proxies to kill Arabs, a risky change of tactics at a time when many Iraqis, Lebanese and other Arabs are already outraged by Iranian meddling in their countries.
Khamenei may be calculating that the Iraqi government will make no more than a token protest at the attacks. It’s a safe bet that the large contingent of Iraqi politicians beholden to Tehran won’t be as offended by Iranian military action on their soil as they professed to be by Soleimani’s killing.
But the Iraqi civilians whose recent protests have been overshadowed by the events of the past week will be outraged by Tehran’s temerity — especially if it emerges that some of their fellow citizens were killed or hurt by the missile attacks. Their protests will grow more determined, and Khamenei will respond the only way he knows how: brute force.
Rather than putting a lid on tensions in Iraq and the Middle East, Iran’s missile attacks will almost certainly turn the dial up a notch."
liberal,"Iran’s Retaliation Is More Conventional Than Expected
After a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last week, America braced itself for the unexpected: The Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory warning that Iran may launch cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. New York’s governor deployed the National Guard to New York City’s major airports.
Those precautions are wise and understandable. But Iran’s missile attacks on bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday shows that the regime’s retaliation may be more conventional than expected.
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has used terrorist groups as proxies to strike at civilians and embassies, attempting to obscure its own responsibility for these attacks. Now the Iranian regime is signaling a new approach. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told his advisers last week that its response should be a “direct and proportional attack on American interests,” according to the New York Times, and that it should be “openly carried out by Iranian forces themselves.” 
That said, there is good reason to doubt that Iran’s response will be limited to this attack. Iran has fought its wars through proxies since the 1990s. This was Soleimani’s legacy. From 2003 until his death last week, he built up militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, waging an imperial war in the shadows on Iran’s behalf throughout the Middle East.
Some analysts acknowledge that Iran’s military has the capability to do a lot of damage, particularly to U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But it “is not going to be able to out-escalate the United States,” says Alireza Nader, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Khamenei understands this, he says, and he may be attempting to convey strength at a moment when the regime has been weakened.
Another possibility is that the U.S. drone strike demolished the strategy of plausible deniability that Iran has relied on for so long. It’s not just that Iran’s generals could no longer count on being spared the fate of the terrorists they cultivated and sponsored. The strike signaled a new U.S. strategy that imposes grave costs for Iran’s broader proxy war.
The regime will almost certainly still depend on its terrorist proxies. But Iran’s missile strike shows that it is prepared to engage in direct military attacks to take revenge for Soleimani. The world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism will also rely on conventional warfare."
liberal,"Trump’s Thin Crisis Team Is Scary, Too
I’ll leave the analysis of the foreign policy and military actions between Iran and the U.S. to the experts. For what it’s worth, my read of the experts after Iran attacked U.S. military bases in Iraq Tuesday night was fairly optimistic; many sense that there’s an opportunity here for President Donald Trump to de-escalate and avoid full-out war. 
What I do know something about is the process of presidential policy formation and implementation. And that leaves me as pessimistic as ever. The U.S. enters this crisis with a woefully thin and inexperienced team.
Trump himself, of course, is no expert. That’s not unusual. Of the postwar presidents, only Dwight Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and perhaps Richard Nixon entered the White House with serious foreign policy and national security credentials. There does seem to be some correlation with success there; Ike, Bush and perhaps Nixon were all quite good at that part of the job. But others have been fine despite coming into the job without a lot of relevant experience. Still, Trump is unusually lacking in relevant experience, and there’s little sign that he’s getting better as he goes along. 
That’s partly because the executive branch and the White House are, among other things, a giant information machine, able to supply a skilled president with expertise on any subject imaginable — not just a single answer, but multiple sources giving expertise from multiple perspectives, all double-checked by White House staffers who are free from the bureaucratic biases that executive branch departments and agencies breed. 
Except when the administration is badly understaffed, as this one has been from Day One. Political scientist Elizabeth Saunders tweeted on Tuesday:
Things that any administration would want right now: a robust communications operation across the US government, including/especially the White House; a full staffed diplomatic corps and civilian shop in the Pentagon; strong relationships with allies.
This administration doesn’t have those things. In fact, as the historian and journalist Garrett Graff pointed out:
Reminder that as this crisis escalates, we have no Director of National Intelligence, no Dep Dir, no Homeland Security Scretary, no Dep Sec, no head of CBP or ICE, no State Dept Under Sec of Arms Control, no Asst Sec for Europe, and no Navy Sec.
Yes, there are acting officials in all of those positions and so many more, but Matt Glassman is correct: “Acting officials are weak. They’re the substitute teachers of political leadership.” That means they’re less likely to stand up to the president and give him information that he needs, and they’re also less likely to be good at soliciting information from their agencies. 

The truth is that the positions that are in place aren’t exactly filled with all-stars, either. That’s what happens when the presidency — not quite three years old yet — is already on its fourth national security adviser, second secretaries of defense and state, third White House chief of staff, and on and on. Record turnover in the White House and the cabinet is like instability in any organization; people don’t really get to know their job properly, or develop good working relationships with others in their own agencies or their counterparts across the government. 

Now, there’s no straight line between these problems and any particular outcome. And the two biggest foreign policy fiascoes since World War II — Vietnam and the Iraq War — were both the products of what were at the time extremely well regarded national security and foreign policy teams. But it almost certainly is true that inexperienced, unqualified and unconfirmed people in key positions increases the chances of things going wrong. 
1. Michael C. Horowitz and Elizabeth N. Saunders at the Monkey Cage on why all-out war between Iran and the U.S. is unlikely.
2. Nathaniel Rakich puts Trump’s approval ratings at the beginning of the election year in historical perspective.
3. Greg Sargent on the increasingly implausible arguments Republican senators are making against impeachment trial witnesses and other evidence.
4. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Feldman on John Bolton. Key point: “If Bolton really wanted to tell his story, nothing stops him from holding a press conference and doing so.” Exactly. And I’d add that Bolton has an ethical obligation to tell that story, whether it helps or hurts Trump.
5. And Ian Richardson on the expected record turnout for the Iowa caucuses. "
liberal,"Trump’s Iran Speech Had Three Audiences

President Donald Trump’s speech on Iran will not go down in memory as eloquent or inspiring — but it gave the world what it needed most today: an opportunity for de-escalation. The U.S. president was unquestionably speaking to many audiences, and most should be more pleased than upset by what they heard.
For Americans, and the president’s supporters in particular, they heard a leader who remains resolute on Iran and unyielding in his objectives to have Iran end its nuclear weapons ambitions and its use of terrorism to destabilize the region and threaten American interests.
For Iranians, although Trump hardly offered an olive branch, the absence of threats of military force should be the key takeaway; it may be the first time the announcement of more sanctions would be welcome in Tehran. Moreover, in several parts of the speech, Trump referenced a desire to see a peaceful and prosperous Iran — without any obvious suggestion of regime change being the prerequisite.
Europeans may see the speech in mixed terms. They are likely to bristle at the president’s call for the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to abandon the nuclear deal. And they will be quite surprised by Trump’s announcement that he will ask NATO to do more in the Middle East — particularly after the United States gave its European allies no warning about the strike on Soleimani, which sharply changed the threat environment for the hundreds of British, German, Dutch, and others serving there.
But Europeans should look beyond those two major points. First, the call to abandon the Iran nuclear deal is not as dramatic as it sounds. Given America’s withdrawal and Iran’s latest violations, it is hard to imagine that deal could be revived without a significant renegotiation of it. Instead, the more noteworthy sentences are the ones that came next: “We must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.” Europeans could and should take this as an invitation to do exactly what seven former European ministerial level officials called for in a statement on Jan. 8: to “urgently position European states as active mediators to de-escalate the situation.”
Second, the request to NATO should not be rejected out of hand. In fact, it may be the most useful suggestion contained in the speech overall. The actions of the last week have precipitated a real crisis between the United States and Iraq — one in which the Iraqi parliament has passed a non-binding resolution calling for the eviction of all foreign forces in Iraq, including the 5,200 American soldiers currently operating there. It is not at all clear that this momentum can be completely reversed. However, incorporating more Americans into the existing NATO training mission in Iraq could be a way to meet intense Iraqi political pressure for change in the status quo without removing all Americans from Iraqi soil.
Iraqis are likely to be the most disappointed of all the constituencies watching President Trump’s speech today. The president lost an opportunity this morning to calm the spike in U.S.-Iraq tensions that have followed the Soleimani killing. Beyond being thankful that no Iraqi lives were lost in the Iranian attacks on U.S. bases last night, the president did not even mention Iraq. He could have instead communicated a series of important messages that may have allowed Baghdad and Washington to launch a slow, deliberative and analytical process to re-evaluate their relationship — rather than the emotional Iraqi calls for eviction and the emotional calls of the president for sanctions on Iraq.

There is still time to make the comments Iraqis want and need to hear. And a further, more practical gesture could also reinforce the de-escalatory intention behind the speech: approving the visa sought (and apparently denied) by Iranian Foreign Minister Javid Zarif to attend UN Security Council meetings in New York this week.
It will take more to dampen the crisis that has gripped the world for the last week. But there are enough positives in the president’s speech to build upon."
liberal,"Trump Doesn’t Want War With Iran
It’s too soon to say whether Iran’s retaliation for the killing of its most important general will be limited to this week’s missile salvo at two U.S.-Iraqi bases in Iraq. As my colleague Bobby Ghosh writes, “The fact that no Americans were killed will do little to slake Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s bloodlust.”  
What is clear, though, is that President Donald Trump is not seeking to invade Iran. To start, he put a positive spin on Iran’s retaliation, saying in a speech Wednesday that the regime “appears to be standing down.” If Trump were really the warmonger that his opponents claim, he would not have described the Iranian attack as a de-escalation.
More to the point, as president Trump has demonstrated that he is uninterested in the lofty goals of nation-building and regime change that once characterized his party. He threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” only to enter negotiations with its tyrant a few months later. He recognized the head of Venezuela’s legislature as the country’s interim president, but has yet to send U.S. forces into Venezuela to oust its dictator.
With Iran, Trump boasted of his decision to end the life of Qassem Soleimani and then threatened to bomb 52 Iranian sites, including cultural ones. On Wednesday, he vowed that Iran would not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon “as long as I am president.”
And yet in that same speech, Trump extended a hand of cooperation to Iran. “The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran,” he said. “We should work together on this and other shared priorities.” This doesn’t sound like a man bent on regime change by military force. They are the words of a president who seeks to deter Iran from targeting Americans and building nuclear weapons. 
Trump’s strategy so far has flummoxed most of his opposition. This week House Democrats will vote on a war powers resolution aimed at limiting the president’s authority to attack Iran. This move would make sense if it were 2002, George W. Bush were president, and an invasion force of more than 100,000 troops were being positioned in the Middle East.
But Trump won his party’s nomination partly by sounding like an anti-war activist, with his attacks on Bush’s legacy in Iraq and accusations that he lied the country into war. Just as defeated generals are often accused of fighting the last war, Democrats are now legislating against the last war.
A more sophisticated argument against Trump’s policy is that the killing of Soleimani was so escalatory that it invites the kind of Iranian retaliation that will make a hot war inevitable. That is indeed a real risk. But if this is the case, Democrats should be bolstering America’s deterrence against Iran, not undermining it.
Instead of offering a resolution to limit Trump’s range of responses to the next Iranian attack, Democrats should warn Iran that it will face more misery if its leaders choose to escalate. It’s not a stance likely to win support from the party’s online activists, many of whom are warning of a repeat of the Iraq war. It is, however, a position that would demonstrate seriousness at a moment of high partisan folly from all sides.
It may also help dissuade Iranian officials from rashly seeking vengeance for Soleimani’s death. It’s sometimes said that war is the failure of diplomacy. That’s not quite right. More often, war is the failure of deterrence."
liberal,"The Asad and Erbil bases were targeted by Iran in retaliation for the killing of a top Revolutionary Guards commander in Baghdad.
American military officials said that Iran had launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against United States military and coalition forces.
Iran fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq where American troops are based, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
“It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Asad and Erbil,” Jonathan Hoffman, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in a statement.
There were no immediate reports of casualties, and the Pentagon said Tuesday evening that it was still assessing the damage.
Iranian officials said the attacks were the start of a promised retaliation for the killing of a top Revolutionary Guards commander. “The fierce revenge by the Revolutionary Guards has begun,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement on a Telegram channel.
Iranian news media reported the attacks hours after the remains of the commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, were returned to his hometown in Iran for burial.
Hossein Soleimani, the editor in chief of Mashregh, the main Revolutionary Guards news website, said that more than 30 ballistic missiles had been fired at the American base at Asad, in Anbar Province, in western Iraq.
An American base in Erbil, in northern Iraq, was also attacked.
Some Iranian officials tweeted images of Iranian flags in a pointed rejoinder to President Trump, who tweeted an American flag after General Suleimani was killed.

In a statement, the White House said, “The president has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.”
Throughout the day, reports from American intelligence agencies of an imminent attack from Iran had intensified, and senior officials said they were bracing for some kind of attack against American bases in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East.
As tensions mounted, Mr. Trump’s top national security advisers met Tuesday afternoon in the White House Situation Room, where they were joined by the president after his meeting with the Greek prime minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was meeting with senior Democrats Tuesday evening in her Capitol office suite, discussing Mr. Trump’s impeachment, when she was handed a note about the Iranian attack.
“We’ve got to pray,” she said, according to Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who was at the meeting.
Ms. Pelosi said she was “closely monitoring the situation.”
“We must ensure the safety of our service members, including ending needless provocations from the administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence,” she said in a tweet. “America & world cannot afford war.”
Drew Hammill, Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman, said she returned a call shortly thereafter from Vice President Mike Pence, who briefed her on the strikes.
Mr. Pence also briefed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.
In December 2018, Mr. Trump visited American military forces at Al Asad. It was his first trip to troops stationed in a combat zone.

The base at Asad is an Iraqi base that has long been a hub for American military operations in western Iraq. Danish troops have also been stationed there in recent years.
MAPPING THE CRISIS:
How the confrontation between the U.S. and Iran escalated.
In 2017, as the American-led coalition built up the base for its campaign against the Islamic State, roughly 500 American military and civilian personnel were located there. Some troops departed after the defeat of the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate in 2019, but the base maintains a robust presence of coalition troops.
The American base in Erbil has been a Special Operations hub, home to hundreds of troops, logistics personnel, and intelligence specialists. Transport aircraft, gunships, and reconnaissance planes have used the airport as an anchor point for operations in both northern Iraq and deep into Syria.
‘He was clearly on the battlefield.’
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Tuesday that General Suleimani had been planning attacks to occur within days, laying out the administration’s legal justification for killing the Iranian commander in a drone strike.
Americans officials have been pressed over their claims that they targeted General Suleimani to forestall imminent attacks against U.S. interests.
At a Pentagon news conference Tuesday, Mr. Esper was asked whether attacks had been expected in days or weeks. “I think it’s more fair to say days,” the defense secretary said.
He declined to offer more details, nor to describe the intelligence underpinning that assessment.
Mr. Esper said General Suleimani, who was killed Friday in Iraq, “was in Baghdad to coordinate additional attacks.”
“He’s been conducting terrorist activities against us and our coalition partners for over 20 years,” Mr. Esper said. “He has the blood of hundreds of Americans, soldiers, on his hands and wounded thousands more. And then we could talk about all of the mayhem he’s caused against the Syrian people, the people of Lebanon. Even his own people in Iran.”
He added: “To somehow suggest that he wasn’t a legitimate target, I think, is fanciful. He was clearly on the battlefield.”
Mr. Esper also said that despite an unsigned draft letter from the American military command in Baghdad on troop withdrawal and a unanimous vote by the Iraqi Parliament, the United States does not plan to pull its troops out of Iraq right now.
The Pentagon has made preparations in anticipation of Iranian retaliation, Mr. Esper said, and American troops in the Middle East are on a heightened state of alert.
“I think we should expect that they will retaliate in some way, shape or form,” Mr. Esper told a news conference at the Pentagon. “We’re prepared for any contingency and then we’ll respond appropriately to whatever they do.”

President Trump walked back his threat to strike Iranian cultural targets.
President Trump on Tuesday told reporters he would avoid targeting cultural sites in military attacks, walking back a threat he made against Iran days earlier.
Following a bipartisan and international uproar, Mr. Trump conceded that striking such sites would amount to a war crime. “If that’s what the law is, I like to obey the law,” he said in the Oval Office as he hosted the visiting prime minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
His remarks to reporters came a day after Mark T. Esper, the secretary of defense, said striking Iranian cultural sites with no military value would be a war crime. That appeared to put him at odds with his boss.
“We will follow the laws of armed conflict,” the defense secretary said at a news briefing at the Pentagon on Monday when asked if cultural sites would be targeted.
On Saturday, Mr. Trump declared that the United States had identified 52 potential targets in Iran, some “important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”
None of them qualified as cultural sites, according to an administration official who asked not to be identified.
But the president’s threats and his initial refusal to back down in the face of criticism generated condemnation at home and abroad while deeply discomfiting American military leaders.
Some NATO troops are leaving Iraq.
NATO is removing some of the trainers who have been working with Iraqi soldiers battling the Islamic State, in the wake of the American killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.
On Monday, the NATO secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced that training had been temporarily suspended.
Describing security of NATO personnel, the organization said in a statement that it would be taking precautions — including “the temporary repositioning of some personnel to different locations both inside and outside Iraq.’’
NATO “maintains a presence in Iraq’’ and remains committed “to fighting international terrorism,” an official said, but refused to provide “operational details’’ about troop movements.
NATO has had roughly 500 soldiers doing the training.
Some NATO countries, like Canada, Germany and Croatia, have announced that they are moving troops out of Iraq altogether, at least temporarily, because of security concerns.
Canada is temporarily moving to Kuwait some of its 500 military personnel based in Iraq, the country’s top military official, Gen. Jonathan Vance, said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
Thirty of the 120 German soldiers in Iraq will be sent to Jordan and Kuwait, while others will remain positioned in the less volatile Kurdistan region, the German defense and foreign ministries said in a joint letter to the German parliament, the Bundestag.
“When the training is able to resume, the military personnel can be reinstated,” the letter said.
Croatia has also moved its small contingent of soldiers — 14 — from Iraq, with seven bound for Kuwait and the rest headed home, the Croatian Defense Ministry said. Slovakia has also removed its seven soldiers.
Some NATO troops began leaving Baghdad’s Green Zone in helicopters Monday night. The NATO training mission began in 2018 at Iraq’s request.
Oil prices have risen only modestly since the U.S. attack.
The killing of General Suleimani initially jolted oil markets, but the surge in prices has eased. On Tuesday afternoon, the Brent crude oil benchmark was down about 1.5 percent, to about $67.87 a barrel.
Analysts attribute the modesty of the increase to market skepticism that Iran will seek to hobble oil trading by, for example, closing the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel that many oil tankers have to pass through when they leave the Persian Gulf.
Oil flows have not been disrupted, so far, and the markets are “pricing in just a low probability of something happening,” said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, a research firm.

Deadly stampede at funeral in Suleimani’s hometown.
Iranian state-run news outlets reported a deadly stampede during the funeral procession for General Suleimani in his hometown, Kerman, in southeastern Iran, on Tuesday.
Millions were reported to have flooded the town’s streets to witness the procession for the general, who was killed in an American drone strike in Baghdad last week. His death has fanned smoldering tensions between the United States and Iran, and fueled fears of a broader conflict.
The crowding and subsequent stampede in Kerman led to General Suleimani’s burial being postponed, state news media reported. It is still unclear when he will be buried.
Photographs of the procession showed an elaborately decorated truck carrying General Suleimani’s coffin through streets packed densely with mourners, many wearing black and carrying pictures of the dead commander.
“Unfortunately, as a result of a stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,” Pirhossein Koulivand, head of the Iranian emergency medical services, told the news agency IRIB.
Fifty-six people died and 213 were injured, the broadcaster IRIB reported on its website.
Images and videos posted on social media showed the aftermath of the crush, with emergency workers and bystanders attempting to resuscitate people lying on the ground. The lifeless bodies of other victims, jackets covering their faces, could be seen nearby.
The general’s body had been flown to Kerman after a funeral in Tehran on Monday that had brought even bigger crowds into the streets of the Iranian capital.

Iran issued new threats before the funeral procession.
In a fiery speech made in General Suleimani’s hometown on Tuesday, the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps vowed to “set ablaze” places where Americans and their allies live.
“We will take revenge — a revenge that will be tough, strong, decisive and finishing and will make them regret,” the corps’s leader, Hossein Salami, said on Tuesday in a front of a crowd of mourners. “We will set ablaze the place they like, and they know where it is.”
“Today, the seeds of hatred for the U.S. have been sown in the hearts of Muslims,” he added, according to Fars, an Iranian news agency associated with the Revolutionary Guards.
The pledge to seek vengeance echoed the rhetoric of many of the country’s leaders since General Suleimani’s killing on Friday. “Death to Israel,” the crowd chanted back, according to news reports. Israel, a close ally of the United States, has long been an enemy of Iran.
Thousands of mourners, dressed in black and carrying photos of General Suleimani, crowded the central square of Kerman, where the general’s body was taken for burial after a funeral procession on Monday in Tehran, the capital.
Before arriving in Kerman, the general’s remains were taken to the holy city of Qom, where thousands of residents came out, hoping for a chance to touch the coffin of a man the state has declared a martyr.

On Monday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wept and offered prayers over General Suleimani’s coffin at the enormous state funeral. The ayatollah, Iran’s supreme leader, had a close relationship with the general, who was widely considered to be the country’s second-most powerful man.
General Suleimani’s successor swore revenge during Monday’s ceremony.
“God the almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger,” said Esmail Ghaani, the Iranian general who will succeed General Suleimani as head of the Quds Force, the foreign expeditionary arm of the Revolutionary Guards. “Certainly, actions will be taken,” he added.
As the world focused on Iran, Putin took a bow in Syria.
With the American role in the Middle East in flux, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew to Damascus, Syria, on Tuesday for a victory lap of sorts.
Highlighting Russia’s newfound influence in the region, Mr. Putin met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, the strongman whose rule was largely rescued by Russian military intervention in Syria’s civil war.
Mr. Putin told Mr. al-Assad that “one can now confidently state that huge strides have been made in restoring Syrian statehood and the territorial integrity of the country,” a Kremlin statement said.
The Kremlin made no mention of Iran in its description of Mr. Putin’s visit, which had not been announced ahead of time. But Tehran was a crucial partner of Moscow in propping up Mr. al-Assad against Syrian rebels, including those backed by the United States.
Russia has called the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran illegal and expressed condolences to Tehran. On Wednesday, Mr. Putin is scheduled to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in Istanbul, with Syria and Libya on the agenda, according to the Kremlin.
France’s president urged calm in a call with his Iranian counterpart.
President Emmanuel Macron of France spoke with the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, by phone on Tuesday afternoon to plead for calm and de-escalation.
Mr. Macron called on Iran to “refrain from any step that might aggravate the escalation already underway,” according to a statement from the Élysée Palace, the seat of the French presidency.
France has tried to play the role of mediator between the Iranians and Americans for months, but in vain.
The French president also called on Iran to respect the 2015 nuclear accord, and to release two French academics, Fariba Adelkhah and Roland Marchal, who are being held there, a major source of tension between the two countries.
Iran’s foreign minister says he was denied visa for U.N.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said on Tuesday that he had been rejected for a visa to attend a Security Council meeting at the United Nations headquarters in New York, confirming reports from American news outlets that he would be barred.
Mr. Zarif, in an interview with the Iranian news outlet Press TV, said that his office had requested a visa weeks ago to participate in the meeting on Thursday, rejecting claims by American officials that they had not had time to process the application.
“The Americans are trying to create the impression that our request to attend the meeting was put forth following the assassination of General Suleimani,” Mr. Zarif said, according to the news outlet, adding, “The question everyone needs to be asking this lawbreaking administration is: What are they so scared of?”
Mr. Zarif later posted on Twitter about the situation, taking aim at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Trump.

During a Tuesday morning news conference, Mr. Pompeo was asked about the visa but said he would not comment specifically on visa matters. He added that the United States would “comply with our obligations” under United Nations rules.
Robert C. O’Brien, the American national security adviser, was asked on “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning about the visa.
“I don’t think Secretary Pompeo thought that this was the right time for Mr. Zarif to come to the United States, and whenever he comes to New York, he spreads propaganda,” Mr. O’Brien said.
In August, the United States announced sanctions on Mr. Zarif, a seasoned diplomat who helped negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal.
Embassies warned Americans abroad of potential attacks.
Across the Middle East and the world, United States embassies warned Americans of potential attacks from Iran, as Iranian generals vowed to avenge the senior commander killed in an American drone strike.
In Jerusalem, the embassy told Americans on Monday to watch out for “mortars and rocket fire.” A day earlier, the United States Mission in Saudi Arabia had warned citizens to be prepared for “missile and drone attacks.”
The security alerts follow the targeted killing on Friday of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leading figure in Iran’s foreign-facing intelligence and military operations.
At General Suleimani’s funeral in Tehran on Monday, military commanders promised vengeance. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told advisers that any retaliation against the United States should be direct, proportional and carried out openly by Iran.
That is a startling departure for the Iranian leadership, which has typically cloaked its attacks behind the actions of proxies it has cultivated around the region. But in the fury generated by the killing of General Suleimani, a close ally and personal friend of the supreme leader, the ayatollah was apparently willing to cast aside those traditional cautions.
Warnings to United State citizens were sent by American diplomats not only in the Middle East but also in Asia.
The American Embassy in Beijing, citing “heightened tension in the Middle East,” advised American citizens on Tuesday to keep a low profile, be aware of their surroundings, stay alert in tourist locations, review personal security plans and ensure that their travel documents were updated and accessible. American citizens in South Korea said they had received similar warnings.
American diplomats in the Middle East began sending advisories earlier in the week.
American embassies across the region have been on heightened alert since Dec. 31, when militants, backed by the Iranian government, stormed the embassy in Baghdad. President Trump said the assault was organized by General Suleimani.
Last week, embassies in Baghdad and in Beirut, Lebanon, issued security alerts. Some airlines have halted flights to the Iraqi capital, including EgyptAir, which on Tuesday announced that its flights in and out of the city would stop from Wednesday through Friday.
Iran’s Parliament labeled the Pentagon’s leadership ‘terrorists.’
The Iranian Parliament on Tuesday passed a bill declaring the American military’s top leadership to be “terrorists,” subject to Iranian sanctions, according to news reports in state media.
The bill aimed at the Pentagon’s top brass mirrored a Trump administration policy implemented in April that imposed economic and travel sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as well as organizations, companies and individuals with ties to it.

That policy represented the first time an arm of a sovereign government had been designated a terrorist organization.
The Defense Department said the killing of General Suleimani was justified in part because of the corps’s terrorist designation. General Suleimani led the Quds Force, a unit of the Revolutionary Guards that conducted intelligence-gathering and attacks outside Iran’s borders.
The Defense Department mistakenly released a letter authorizing troop withdrawal from Iraq.
An official letter from the Defense Department informing Iraq that American troops were “repositioning forces” for “movement out of Iraq” produced headlines around the world saying that an American withdrawal had begun.
But the letter, drafted by the United States military command in Baghdad, was sent out by mistake. The furor it caused prompted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, to call an urgent news conference to deny the reports.
“It was an honest mistake,” General Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. “That letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.”"
liberal,"Joe Biden, Seeking Commander-in-Chief Moment, Denounces Trump’s Iran Aggression
Because the president “refuses to level with the American people” about the dangers United States troops and civilians now face in the Middle East, Mr. Biden said, “I will attempt to do that.”
By Katie Glueck
•	Jan. 7, 2020Updated 7:40 p.m. ET
Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday delivered a forceful and detailed critique of the Trump administration’s escalation toward Iran as he sought at every turn to highlight his own commander-in-chief credentials and to evoke the stature of a president.
The former vice president, speaking from Pier 59 in New York against a backdrop of American flags, delivered a stern warning about President Trump’s stewardship of international affairs and painted a grim picture of the dangerous landscape in the Middle East.
Mr. Biden cast Mr. Trump as a hypocrite who preaches an inward-looking foreign policy but operates using unsteady, bellicose tactics, and faulted the president for bringing the nation “dangerously close” to war after an American drone strike that killed one of Iran’s top military commanders, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.
“Because he refuses to level with the American people about the dangers which he has placed American troops and our diplomatic corps, personnel and civilians, as well as our partners and allies, or demonstrated even a modicum of presidential gravitas, I will attempt to do that,” said Mr. Biden, who is one of 14 candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. “That starts with an honest accounting of how we got where we are.”

Hours after he spoke, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against United States military and coalition forces in Iraq, according to American military officials.

 Two United States bases in Iraq were targeted in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian commander.
All of the leading Democratic candidates have excoriated the Trump administration over its posture toward Iran. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has used the moment to highlight his longstanding antiwar credentials — and to point out, obliquely and explicitly, Mr. Biden’s vote to authorize the war in Iraq. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., a military veteran, has emphasized his personal experience in a war zone. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has also denounced the administration’s actions, most recently in an appearance Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” during which she said that by killing General Suleimani, Mr. Trump had “moved us close to the edge of war.”
THE 2020 RACE
Elizabeth Warren’s new bankruptcy plan revives a clash with Joe Biden.
In Mr. Biden’s telling, the chaos America now confronts — “heightened threats, chants of ‘death to America’ once more echoing across the Middle East,” with Iran and its allies “vowing revenge” — was stoked by Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal that was negotiated under the Obama administration.
He described a series of subsequent provocations and challenges for which the Trump administration, he argued, was unprepared, even as he also said that he had “no illusions about Iran,” led by a government that he said threatened American interests. But the decision to kill General Suleimani “may well do more to strengthen Iran’s position in the region than any of Suleimani’s plots would have ever accomplished,” he said, arguing that Mr. Trump owed the nation answers but had delivered only “tweets, threats and tantrums.”
General Suleimani was designated by the United States as a terrorist, and was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Tuesday that attacks orchestrated by General Suleimani were expected within “days,” adding that he “has the blood of hundreds of Americans, soldiers, on his hands and wounded thousands more,” and many Republicans, including some who are typically critical of Mr. Trump, said the action had made the nation safer. Democrats, too, including Mr. Biden, have said General Suleimani should face justice. But other officials have questioned whether an attack was in fact imminent.
Mr. Biden said that if there was an “imminent threat” that warranted this “extraordinary action,” Americans should receive “an explanation and the facts to back it up.”
“At precisely the moment when we should be rallying our allies to stand beside us and hold the line against threats, Donald Trump’s shortsighted, ‘America First’ dogmatism has come home to roost,” Mr. Biden said. He went on to add, “We are alone now. We’re alone and we’ll have to bear the cost of Donald Trump’s folly.”
On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden has emphasized his decades-long record in international affairs and extensive relationships abroad, highlighting a contrast with his rivals in the Democratic field, who have largely been focused on domestic matters throughout the race. In New York, the setting appeared designed to conjure the White House briefing room: Mr. Biden spoke against a blue backdrop before a room full of reporters. He walked in to the clicking of multiple cameras and offered his own prescription for the path forward, calling for “cleareyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in a strategy that’s not about one-off decisions and one-upsmanship.”
“Mr. President,” he urged, “you have to explain your decision and your strategy to the American people. That’s your job as president, Mr. President. Not ‘Dear Leader.’ Not ‘Supreme Leader.’ Democracy runs on accountability, and nowhere is it more important than the power to make war and bring peace.”
Mr. Biden, who has faced renewed scrutiny of his foreign policy record and especially his Iraq war vote, also appeared to misspeak at times, referring to Iran when he apparently intended to say Iraq, and he appeared to say that the current perilous situation was “unavoidable,” when excerpts from the speech circulated before the appearance used the word “avoidable.”
Still, Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies hope that the gravity of the moment will further crystallize the importance of defeating Mr. Trump in the minds of voters, and polls continue to show that Democrats believe Mr. Biden has the best chance to do so, though other candidates have also polled strongly against the president in hypothetical head-to-head matchups.
The current crisis “just reinforces how high the stakes are in this election,” Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser earlier Tuesday, during which he also envisioned a Senate dynamic in which one could see “Mitch McConnell changing some ideas or being more — how can I say — mildly cooperative,” even as Mr. Biden also discussed the imperative for Democrats to win back the Senate, revoking Mr. McConnell’s title as majority leader.
Mr. Biden was not the only presidential candidate to castigate the Trump administration’s handling of foreign policy on Tuesday.
Speaking Tuesday on “The View,” Ms. Warren said that “Suleimani was a bad guy, but the question is, what’s the right response?”
“The job of the president of the United States is to keep America safer,” she added. “And having killed Suleimani does not make America safer.”
As evidence, Ms. Warren cited the withdrawal of American citizens from the region because of safety concerns and said Mr. Trump had tweeted “threats of war crimes” by threatening to strike cultural institutions.
“We need a president who actually has good judgment, and is willing to follow through,” she said.
Pressed on whether she believed General Suleimani to be a terrorist, Ms. Warren said: “Of course he is. He’s part of a group that our federal government has designated as a terrorist.”
As for how she would handle foreign policy in the Middle East, she said, “It is the responsibility of the commander in chief not to ask our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily.”
“The point is not whether or not Iran is a bad actor — they are,” she added. “But the question is: What are the right steps for the president? Use our diplomacy. Use the back channels. De-escalate and get Iran to the negotiating table.”

liberal,"Bolton Is Willing to Testify in Trump Impeachment Trial, Raising Pressure for Witnesses
The former national security adviser, who has complied with a White House directive not to cooperate in the inquiry, said he would testify if the Senate subpoenaed him.
By Nicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt
•	Jan. 6, 2020
WASHINGTON — John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, said on Monday that he was willing to testify at President Trump’s impeachment trial, putting new pressure on Republicans to call witnesses and raising the possibility of revelations as the Senate weighs Mr. Trump’s removal.
Mr. Bolton’s surprise declaration, in a statement on his website, was a dramatic turn that could alter the political dynamic of the impeachment process in the Senate and raise the risks for Mr. Trump of Republican defections. The former national security adviser is a potentially vital witness, with direct knowledge of presidential actions and conversations regarding Ukraine that could fill in blanks in the narrative of the impeachment case.
It came as the House continued to withhold the articles of impeachment necessary to start the trial in a bid to increase Democratic leverage in Senate negotiations over calling Mr. Bolton and three other administration witnesses the president blocked from testifying in the House inquiry.
“I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,” Mr. Bolton said in the statement.
His decision raised immediate questions for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, around how to proceed with the trial. He has steadfastly refused to commit to calling witnesses, but as majority leader, he must also weigh the wishes of a small group of moderate Republicans who may press to hear from them.
Mr. Bolton announced his intentions minutes after leaving a voice mail message alerting Mr. McConnell of them.
Democrats quickly seized on Mr. Bolton’s public declaration to press their case that the Senate must hear from him and the other senior officials at the outset of any trial, training attention on the few Republicans who have said they are open to calling witnesses.
“Given that Mr. Bolton’s lawyers have stated he has new relevant information to share, if any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we have requested, they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover-up,” the Democratic leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, said in a speech on the Senate floor.
But Mr. McConnell appeared unmoved by the development, and there was no immediate clamor from rank-and-file Republicans for him to change his stance. Instead, the loudest voices in the party on Monday were from a group of Republican senators who spent the day trumpeting a newly introduced resolution that would alter Senate rules to allow the chamber to dismiss the House case without a trial.
It was unclear how the White House would respond to Mr. Bolton, who left his post in September amid sharp disputes with Mr. Trump. The president did not address his former adviser in an interview with Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio host, that aired on Monday, but he accused Democrats of trying to “affect the election illegally” by impeaching him.
Mr. Bolton did not say precisely what he would be willing to tell Congress. But his lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, told the House’s top lawyer in November that Mr. Bolton knew about “many relevant meetings and conversations” connected to the Ukraine matter that had not been shared with House impeachment investigators. And former White House officials and people close to Mr. Bolton have indicated that his testimony would most likely be damning to Mr. Trump and put additional pressure on moderate Republicans to consider convicting him.
While that could cause some Republican defections, it is unlikely to put him at great risk in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote — 67 senators — is needed to remove a president. Mr. McConnell has confidently predicted Mr. Trump’s acquittal.
The two parties have been at an impasse over the issue of witnesses for weeks now, and the dispute has delayed the start of Mr. Trump’s trial. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, has declined to send the Senate the charges against Mr. Trump, which would prompt the start of the trial, saying that she first wants assurances that Mr. McConnell would run a fair process.
Mr. McConnell argues the Senate should not even consider admitting new information in the trial until after it hears opening arguments from the prosecution and the defense. He addressed the only development obliquely in a speech on Monday afternoon, accusing Democrats of trying to “pre-commit the Senate to redoing House Democrats’ slapdash work for them, and pursuing avenues” that the House did not.
“The Senate has a unanimous, bipartisan precedent for when to handle midtrial questions such as witnesses: In the middle of the trial,” Mr. McConnell said.
The matter is all but certain to come to a vote at some point, and under Senate rules, it takes only 51 senators to call a witness or request new evidence, meaning Mr. McConnell’s ability to call the shots is limited. Democrats are focused on persuading moderate Republicans — like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah — to join them in insisting on witnesses.
Mr. Romney told reporters on Monday that hearing from Mr. Bolton would be a “good thing” that he hoped would come to pass, though he declined to commit to voting for a subpoena until the shape of the trial was clear. Ms. Collins said that she would make determinations about witnesses only after the Senate heard opening arguments in the eventual trial.
Ms. Murkowski said she, too, agreed with Mr. McConnell’s position and would prefer to wait to address the need for witnesses until midtrial, as was done in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
Despite Mr. Bolton’s offer, many Republicans made clear they were opposed to hearing from any new witnesses. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida wrote on Twitter that the Senate should only consider “the same testimony & evidence the House relied upon when they passed the Articles of Impeachment.”
“Our job is to vote on what the House passed, not to conduct an open ended inquiry,” he tweeted.
Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, went further, introducing a long-shot resolution to allow the Senate to dismiss the articles of impeachment if the House failed to deliver them within 25 calendar days.
“If Speaker Pelosi is afraid to try her case,” Mr. Hawley said, “the articles should be dismissed for failure to prosecute and Congress should get back to doing the people’s business.”
If he did appear under oath on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bolton would be the closest adviser to the president to answer questions about what Mr. Trump said behind closed doors as he pressured the Ukranians to investigate his political rivals as he was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from the country.
The Democratic-led House impeached Mr. Trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, charging him with a corrupt scheme to solicit help from Ukraine in the 2020 election and concealing his actions from Congress.

The president has repeatedly sought to block his most senior aides, as well as former advisers who have left the White House, from speaking to Congress, and has gone to court to stop several of them from cooperating.
Mr. Bolton’s statement strongly suggested that he would be willing to testify regardless of whether Mr. Trump sought to prevent him, and even in the absence of a legal ruling compelling him to do so.
“It now falls to the Senate to fulfill its constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts,” Mr. Bolton wrote. “Accordingly, since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study.”
Although Mr. Bolton never spoke with House investigators, his aides testified that he had been deeply concerned about how Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani pressured the Ukranians to investigate Democrats. A top former deputy said Mr. Bolton alluded metaphorically to a “drug deal” that some top White House officials were involved in regarding the investigations, and called Mr. Giuliani “a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up.”
Others described a campaign by Mr. Bolton to persuade Mr. Trump to release his hold on the military assistance for Ukraine, a case he made to the president at one point.
Mr. Bolton had previously said he would abide by the ruling of a federal judge in a separate lawsuit by his former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, over whether to appear as requested in the House impeachment inquiry or comply with a White House directive to stay silent. But House Democrats withdrew their subpoena for Mr. Kupperman, arguing that they did not have time to await the outcome of a potentially yearslong lawsuit before moving to impeach Mr. Trump.
The judge ruled late last month that the issue was moot, which Mr. Bolton said left him no choice but to make his own decision.

liberal,"What Is Trump’s Iran Strategy? Few Seem to Know
Friend and foe alike are left puzzled over what President Trump aimed to achieve by killing a top Iranian general, what he might do next or how Tehran could mollify him.
By Max Fisher
•	Published Jan. 6, 2020Updated Jan. 7, 2020, 8:17 p.m. ET
When the United States announced on Friday that it had killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, something about its explanation left many analysts puzzled.
The strike was intended to deter further Iranian attacks, administration officials said. But they also said it was also expected to provoke severe enough attacks by Iran that the Pentagon was deploying an additional several thousand troops to the region.
LIVE UPDATES

The apparent contradiction left many experts wondering about the strike’s intended goal, and the strategy behind it.
The next day did little to settle the matter. The strike had been intended to prevent an imminent Iranian attack, officials said publicly. Or to change the behavior of Iran’s surviving leaders. Or to cow those leaders, whose behavior would never change.
Others said privately that President Trump had ordered it in response to television reports of an Iranian-backed siege on the American Embassy compound in Baghdad.
Mr. Suleimani’s killing has left a swirl of confusion among analysts, former policymakers and academics. The United States had initiated a sudden, drastic escalation against a regional power, risking fierce retaliation, or even war.
Why?
“There’s not a single person that I’ve spoken to who can tell you what Trump is up to with Iran,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

It’s not that experts or foreign officials suspect a secret agenda, but that the administration’s action fit no clear pattern or long-term strategy, she said. “It just doesn’t add up.”
The killing, many say, deepens the uncertainty that has surrounded Mr. Trump’s ambitions toward Iran since he withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear accord and began a series of provocations that he terms maximum pressure.
The risk, experts say, is that if they cannot figure out the administration’s goals and priorities for Iran, its red lines and points of possible compromise, then foreign governments won’t be able to either.
“Absolutely not,” Ms. Geranmayeh said when asked whether European or Middle Eastern officials, whom she speaks with regularly, understood Mr. Trump’s strategy. “Not even the closest U.S. allies, like in London.”

This imposes a layer of confusion on the conflict, just as it enters a dangerous and volatile new chapter, inviting mixed messages and misread intentions.
“If it’s that hard for us to understand, imagine the Iranians,” said Dalia Dassa Kaye, who directs a Middle East policy center at RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan research group.
Mixed signals, she said, make any effort to shape an adversary’s behavior “incredibly ineffective.” Uncertainty about Mr. Trump’s intentions also increases risks that the conflict could spiral out of control.
Without a clear understanding of what actions will lead the United States to ramp up or ramp down hostilities, she said, Iranian leaders are operating in the dark — and waiting to stumble past some unseen red line.
“That’s what makes this a dangerous situation,” she said.
How Confusion Fell Over America’s Iran Strategy
Part of the uncertainty is specific to Mr. Trump. His impulsive style and resistance to accepting difficult trade-offs have made his goals on Iran difficult to parse.
He has cycled between ambitions of withdrawing from the Middle East, positioning himself as a once-in-a-generation peacemaker and, more recently, promising to oppose Iran more forcefully than any recent president has.
He has also been pulled between his advisers, with some urging cautious adherence to the status quo and others arguing for overtly topping Iran’s government.
Mr. Trump’s reputation for distortions and untruths have also made it difficult to separate bluster from agenda-setting.
He took the United States out of the nuclear agreement and imposed sanctions against Iran — which some see as setting off a crisis that continues today — on claims that it was “on the cusp” of acquiring nuclear weapons “in just a short period of time.”
But international inspectors and United States military leaders said that Iran was complying with requirements to freeze its nuclear development.
Without a clear explanation for Mr. Trump’s behavior, anyone whose job requires forecasting the next American action — from foreign head of state to think tank analyst — was left guessing.
Deepening the challenge, the administration followed up with a set of demands that included some nuclear restrictions but focused mostly on Iran’s regional influence and proxy forces, ordering Tehran to sever ties to nearly all of them in a sweeping surrender.
Was this the real agenda? If so, what were the plans for winning each demand, and the metrics for measuring whether those plans were working? How would the administration balance competing priorities?
American action on the ground deepened confusion.
United States diplomacy has emphasized calls for peace but has conspicuously declined to offer what diplomats call “offramps” — easy, low-stakes opportunities for both sides to begin de-escalating, which are considered essential first steps.
“There’s been no talk of, say, ‘If you do this, then we’ll bring back waivers,’” Ms. Kaye said, referring to American waivers allowing other countries to buy Iranian oil. “‘If you do X, then you’ll get Y.’ There’s been nothing tangible like that.”
Throughout months of proxy conflict, American military responses have ranged from muted or nonexistent — as in the case of an attack on Saudi oil facilities that was believed to be the work of Iran — to extreme escalations like killing Mr. Suleimani.
Even if each action might be defensible on its own, experts and foreign officials have strained to match them with a consistent set of motives and objectives.
Suspicions have deepened that there may be no long-term strategy at all, even among those sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s policies.
R. Nicholas Burns, a senior State Department official under President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter that the United States might have had a “legitimate right” to kill General Suleimani.
But, he asked, “has Trump considered next 15 moves on chessboard? How to protect our people? Line up allies to support us? Contain Iran but avoid wider war? My guess is he hasn’t.”
Stumbling in the Dark
Ms. Geranmayeh stressed that the conflict between the United States and Iran also threatens to draw in a host of Middle Eastern and European countries.
To navigate tensions and avoid worsening them, allies and adversaries alike must astutely judge American intentions and anticipate American actions.
All of them, she said, seemed at a loss.
“Most experts and officials that I’ve spoken to from the Middle East, including close allies — Saudi Arabia, Israel — they also can’t tell you with confidence what Trump wants on Iran,” she said.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had already been ramping down tensions with Iran, Ms. Geranmayeh said, “because they have no idea how Trump will behave from one week to the next” and fear getting caught in the middle.
Similar confusion in Tehran, she added, could become “the biggest problem.”
“If Trump is not managing a consistent and clear message to the Iranians about what he wants,” she said, “then this opens up a lot of space for a lot of miscalculation.”
The most important question, Ms. Kaye said, is what steps by Iran might cause Mr. Trump to pull back. “There’s not an understanding about what is the end game, what is the U.S. trying to achieve, when will the Trump administration be happy, and enough is enough,” she said.
And while judging what will provoke American escalations against Iran is not straightforward, she said, those escalations have come steadily enough as to seem almost inevitable.
“Action on the ground has been continuously punitive,” she said.
Brett McGurk, who until last year was the administration’s special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State, warned his former bosses, in an article for Foreign Affairs, that their maximalist demands had left “no plausible on-ramp for Iran to enter negotiations, since nobody, including the Iranians, knows what Iran is supposed to negotiate about.”"
liberal,"Trump Backs Away From Further Military Conflict With Iran
The morning after Iranian missiles fell on bases housing American troops in Iraq, the president said that no Americans were harmed and that Iran now “appears to be standing down.”
 “Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” Mr. Trump said in a televised statement from the Grand Foyer of the White House, flanked by his vice president, cabinet secretaries and senior military officers in their uniforms.
The president vowed again not to let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon and warned it against future terrorism or destabilizing actions in the region, but otherwise avoided the bombastic threats that had characterized his public remarks in recent days. Instead, he said he would impose more economic sanctions on Iran and called on NATO allies to become more involved in the Middle East.
“The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it,” Mr. Trump said after outlining American combat potential. “We do not want to use it.” He expressed willingness to negotiate with Iran. “The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it,” he said.
He added that Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China should recognize that the nuclear agreement they sealed along with President Barack Obama in 2015 is effectively dead, and called on them to join him in negotiating a replacement that would go further to constrain Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
“They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or J.C.P.O.A., and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place,” Mr. Trump said.
Video
His comments came the morning after Iran fired a reported 22 ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house United States troops in response to last week’s American drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, commander of Iran’s elite security and intelligence forces. No American or Iraqi troops were injured or killed in the latest attacks, the president said.
In the hours since, some analysts expressed cautious optimism that the missile strikes might prove the end of the immediate conflict rather than the start of a larger confrontation that could spiral into a full-fledged war. They could have been a face-saving way for Iran to say it had responded forcefully to the killing of General Suleimani without actually hurting any Americans, which would quite likely have provoked Mr. Trump into escalating further.
Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said after the missile strikes that Iran had “concluded proportionate measures” in retribution for General Suleimani’s death, and Mr. Trump’s response seemed to indicate an openness to forgoing any reprisals since there were no casualties.
But analysts cautioned that even if the two sides ease off a military clash in the short term, the conflict could very well play out in other ways in the weeks and months to come. Iran has many proxy groups in the Middle East that could stir trouble in new ways for American troops or American allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, and experts remained wary of a possible Iranian cyberstrike on domestic facilities.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran made clear that his country still saw its mission over the long run as driving the United States out of the Middle East after the killing of General Suleimani. “Our final answer to his assassination will be to kick all US forces out of the region,” Mr. Rouhani wrote on Twitter.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, likewise suggested on Wednesday that an incremental operation would not be the end of the clash. “What matters is that the presence of America, which is a source of corruption in this region, should come to an end,” he said in a speech to a hall filled with imams and others, who chanted, “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!”
The operation against General Suleimani may prove to have consequences beyond the direct relationship with Iran. Outraged that the general was killed after arriving at Baghdad International Airport, Iraq’s Parliament voted to expel the 5,000 American troops from the country. Such a decision would still have to be enacted by the caretaker government, but the Pentagon has begun preparing for the possibility of losing its bases in the country nearly 17 years after the invasion ordered by President George W. Bush.
Mr. Trump’s 10-minute televised statement on Wednesday morning was his most extended effort to explain the situation with Iran to the country after last Thursday’s drone strike on General Suleimani. Aside from a four-minute statement on Friday morning, he has stuck to Twitter blasts, comments to reporters and a call into Rush Limbaugh’s radio show without making an official speech outlining his thinking.
To demonstrate unity, he surrounded himself with his top team, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser. They all stood stoically around the president without commenting.
The administration’s messages have at times been conflicting and confusing. The president was forced to walk back threats to target Iranian cultural sites after his defense secretary made clear that doing so would be a war crime. The American headquarters in Baghdad had drafted a letter indicating it was withdrawing from Iraq, only to have the Defense Department say it was a draft document with no authority.
And the administration has not given a detailed public explanation of its reasoning for conducting the strike now, given that General Suleimani has been responsible for killing American soldiers and stirring trouble in the region for many years. Officials at times have asserted that the administration was acting to forestall an “imminent” threat and at others have stressed that it was responding to his past actions.

Congressional Democrats have complained that the administration has not been much more forthcoming in a classified war powers notice or in briefings, raising questions about the nature of the intelligence used to justify the drone strike. Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, and other administration officials were scheduled to brief the entire House and Senate on Wednesday.
The White House has said the president acted under his constitutional authority to take action in self-defense as well as in keeping with the power granted by Congress in a 2002 measure that authorized Mr. Bush’s invasion. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she would hold a House vote this week on legislation meant to rein in the president’s ability to go to war with Iran, although such a measure presumably would not be accepted by the Republican-controlled Senate, much less signed into law by Mr. Trump.
But some Democrats urged Mr. Trump to pull back from further military escalation anyway. “Both sides need to find offramps to avoid conflict from spiraling further out of control,” said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Iran claims it does not seek escalation or war. Now is our chance to let them prove it. President Trump should look at diplomatic options and remember that our greatest strength has never been our military might but our global leadership.”
Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, seemed to nudge Mr. Trump not to ratchet up the conflict further. “As a superpower, we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing if need be,” he said on the floor. “I believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life, but is rightly prepared to protect American lives and interests.”
General Suleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was the architect of Iran’s efforts to extend its influence throughout the Middle East. He helped direct wars in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen as he sought to establish a regional bloc of Shiite power, and he was held responsible by the United States for attacks on American troops in Iraq that killed at least 600 during the height of the Iraq war.
More recently, American officials pointed to General Suleimani as the force behind a Dec. 27 rocket attack on a base in Iraq that killed an American civilian contractor. They said he had traveled the region in recent days as part of preparations for a future attack that could have killed hundreds of Americans; however, they provided scant details and no evidence.
Mr. Trump defended his decision to order the drone strike, calling General Suleimani “the world’s top terrorist” responsible “for some of the absolutely worst atrocities” of recent years.
“In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him,” Mr. Trump said without elaborating. “Suleimani’s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago.”
Mr. Trump has seen Iran as the main enemy of the United States since taking office, withdrawing from Mr. Obama’s nuclear agreement in 2018 and reimposing sanctions in hopes of crippling its economy. Tehran has vowed to abandon constraints in the Obama agreement and proceed with developing its nuclear capabilities.
The Iranian missile strikes, which began early Wednesday morning local time or late Tuesday in Washington, targeted Al Asad Air Base, long a hub for American military operations in Iraq, and another base in Erbil in northern Iraq, which has been a home for Special Operations forces in the fight against the Islamic State both in Iraq and in Syria.
In the hours afterward, Mr. Trump seemed to indicate that the Iranian missiles did no meaningful damage. “All is well!” he wrote on Twitter. “Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!”"
liberal,"The Trump We Did Not Want to See
When are we going to stop trying to rationalize the irrational?
Much of the work of H.P. Lovecraft, an American horror and science fiction writer who worked during the first decades of the 20th century, is defined by individual encounters with the incomprehensible, with sights, sounds and ideas that undermine and disturb reality as his characters understand it. Faced with things too monstrous to be real, but which exist nonetheless, Lovecraftian protagonists either reject their senses or descend into madness, unable to live with what they’ve learned.
It feels, at times, that when it comes to Donald Trump, our political class is this Lovecraftian protagonist, struggling to understand an incomprehensibly abnormal president. The reality of Donald Trump — an amoral narcissist with no capacity for reflection or personal growth — is evident from his decades in public life. But rather than face this, too many people have rejected the facts in front of them, choosing an illusion instead of the disturbing truth.
The past week has been a prime example of this phenomenon. On Thursday night, the United States killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran leader of the Islamic Republic’s Quds Force and one of the most powerful military leaders in the region. The strike was sudden and unexpected. The White House notified Congress only after the fact, with a brief, classified document.
The assassination of Suleimani was tantamount to a declaration of war and has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran. Tehran has already promised “harsh revenge” against the United States, while Trump said he would “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD” if Iran made good on its threat, vowing an attack on “52 Iranian sites” including locations “important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”
This standoff, which in its latest incarnation saw Iranian missiles sailing toward bases in Iraq on Tuesday night, is so consequential that it’s been hard not to impute some logic to the president’s actions, even as many observers acknowledge the lies and dysfunction surrounding the attack. It’s only natural. As humans, we want to impose order on what we see. As Americans, we want to believe our leaders understand the gravity of war. Traditional news outlets published detailed descriptions of the president’s decision-making process. Sympathetic observers, like Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon, hailed the strike as a “stunning blow to international terrorism and a reassertion of American might.” Cable news analysts spoke as if this was part of a considered plan for challenging the Iranian government.
JAMELLE BOUIE’S NEWSLETTER
But we’ve learned since that the strike on Suleimani was almost certainly another impulsive action from an impatient president. Pentagon officials have said they were stunned by the decision. According to reporting in The Times, they gave Trump the option of an attack with the expectation that he would reject it for being too extreme. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for an attack on Iran for some time, but the past few days of confusion — of mixed-messages and shifting rationales — are evidence that this strike was made with little thought to the consequences, justified after the fact with claims of imminent danger.
This is reckless but it isn’t shocking. Trump is not a steady hand. He’s never been one. Three years in office have neither changed his character nor enhanced his capabilities. He is as ignorant and incurious as a president as he was as a candidate (and as a would-be mogul before that). His main goal is self-preservation, and he’ll sacrifice anything to achieve it. His current assault on the authority of Congress — his refusal to have the White House or members of his administration release documents or obey subpoenas — is an attempt to escape responsibility for his own unethical (and potentially illegal) actions. He is self-involved, unethical and unstable — a dangerous combination to have for the commander-in-chief of the world’s most powerful military forces, under pressure from impeachment and a re-election campaign.
I think most observers know this. But the implications are terrifying. They suggest a much more dangerous world than the one we already believe we live in, where in a fit of pique, a single action taken by a single man could have catastrophic consequences for millions of people. This isn’t a new observation. When he was still a rival — and not one of Trump’s most reliable allies — Senator Marco Rubio of Florida warned Republicans that they shouldn’t give “the nuclear codes of the United States” to an “erratic individual.” Hillary Clinton said Trump was “temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility” and that “a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.”
Fear of what Trump would do with the power of the presidency was so acute that his defenders actually urged critics to ignore his actual words in favor of symbolic understanding, to take him “seriously” but not “literally.” You can even understand the constant drive to normalize Trump as an attempt to turn away from the reality of what he is for fear of what it means.
Somehow, we’re still doing it. Everything we know about Trump says he doesn’t make considered choices. Pence and Pompeo may have campaigned for an attack on Iran, but there’s no evidence that Trump — the actual president — has planned for the consequences, or has a rationale for the strike other than his usual brand of bellicose nationalism. When Iran retaliated Tuesday night, the president did not speak, although of course he tweeted. No one knows what the administration will do next.
In his careless thrashing, the president may have started a war with no plan to end it and no regard for the lives that will be lost. The situation is precarious. It’s scary to think about. But we cannot look away."
liberal,"Pelosi Announces Vote to Limit Trump’s War-Making Power Against Iran
The House is expected to vote on Thursday on a resolution to force the president to halt any military action against Iran unless Congress authorizes it.

— Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Wednesday that the House would vote on Thursday to force President Trump to quickly wind down military action against Iran unless he is given explicit authorization from Congress, opening what promised to be a searing debate over presidential war powers.
Ms. Pelosi made her announcement as lawmakers breathed a sigh of relief on Capitol Hill after Mr. Trump announced he would back away from any military escalation against Tehran. But congressional Democrats, skeptical of the administration’s case for the drone strike last week that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani and dissatisfied with the rationale Mr. Trump’s team offered for taking it, pledged to press ahead with their efforts to rein in the president’s war-making authority.
They said they would press forward with a measure that would require that Mr. Trump cease all military action against Iran within 30 days unless Congress votes to approve it. The measure stands little chance in the Republican-controlled Senate, but it is certain to ignite a fierce debate over Mr. Trump’s strategy on Iran, and Congress’s role in curtailing a president’s ability to wage war.
“Members of Congress have serious, urgent concerns about the administration’s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran and about its lack of strategy moving forward,” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. “Our concerns were not addressed by the president’s insufficient War Powers Act notification and by the administration’s briefing today.”
After a dizzying pace of developments in Washington unfolded overnight — missile strikes on Tuesday night on bases in Iraq where American troops are stationed, followed by Mr. Trump’s speech and a set of classified briefings by administration officials on Capitol Hill — by Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers had dug into their respective, partisan corners.
Republicans praised Mr. Trump for his show of restraint. He had been right to target General Suleimani, they argued, adding that the decision had been vindicated by Iran’s response, a telegraphed set of airstrikes that did not kill any Americans or Iraqis and seemed calculated to send a message rather than provoke further hostilities.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, commended the president’s “patience and prudence” in deliberating over how to respond to the strikes, which damaged two bases.
“As a superpower, we have the capacity to exercise restraint and to respond at a time and place of our choosing, if need be,” he said. “I believe the president wants to avoid conflict or needless loss of life. But he’s rightly prepared to protect American lives and interests.”
But Democrats voiced grave concerns about the president’s actions and what they called the dearth of credible information coming from the administration about his strategy on Iran. They added that the Iranian attacks had only strengthened their resolve to reassert Congress’s role in matters of war."
liberal,"Trump Falsely Claims That Ukraine Aid Arrived ‘Ahead of Schedule’
The president also made inaccurate claims on Tuesday about ISIS fighters and his record on the Iraq war.

o	
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
“By the way, in terms of the money, it got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule, long before it was supposed to be there.”
False. President Trump was wrong in asserting that his decision last year to suspend military assistance to Ukraine — a key component in his impeachment and upcoming trial — did not interfere with the schedule for delivering the aid.
The 2019 federal fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, the date by which all appropriated aid to Ukraine was supposed to be disbursed. But because of the freeze ordered by Mr. Trump, not all of the aid was spent before the deadline.
Congress had appropriated $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine — $250 million from the Pentagon and $141 million from the State Department — meant to be spent by the end of September. Though the Pentagon announced its plans to provide the aid in June, White House officials blocked its release in July. It remained frozen until mid-September, when Mr. Trump relented after pressure from lawmakers and administration officials.
With just two weeks left in the fiscal year, the Pentagon was unable to fully disburse the funds. According to testimony from Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget, about $35 million was left unspent. Congress then extended the deadline to the 2020 fiscal year to allow for the disbursement of the remaining aid.
“Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of Sept. 30 would have expired,” Mr. Sandy said.
WHAT MR. TRUMP SAID
“We have thousands of ISIS prisoners that we’re keeping right now under lock and key. And we want Europe to take many of these prisoners because they came from Germany, France and other places — probably a few from Greece, in all fairness.”
This is exaggerated. Estimates from Mr. Trump’s own administration show that he is overstating the share of Islamic State fighters who hail from Europe.
James F. Jeffrey, the State Department’s special envoy for Syria, said in August that about 8,000 ISIS fighters from Syria and Iraq and another 2,000 foreign fighters were being detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the loose coalition of militias fighting the terrorist group.
Of those foreign fighters, about 800 are European and the rest are from former Soviet republics, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia, according to a Pentagon inspector general report from August. The report and other analysts have noted that many of those places are hesitant to repatriate their citizens, fearing political backlash or hurdles in prosecution.
As for Mr. Trump’s contention that a “few” ISIS fighters are Greek nationals, the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project concluded that the number was “not well documented” but said that Greece had been used as a transit point for fighters of European origin. A July report from the London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization estimated that women and children affiliated with the Islamic State numbered about 6,600 from Western Europe but none from Greece.
Mr. Trump previously received pushback from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, when he told Mr. Macron in December that “many” fighters come from France.
“Let’s be serious,” Mr. Macron said accurately. “The very large numbers of fighters on the ground are the fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq.”
OTHER CLAIMS
Mr. Trump also revived claims that The New York Times has previously fact-checked, including his often repeated falsehood that he opposed the Iraq war “in the first place” (he did not) and his exaggerated contention that European countries are not contributing assistance to Ukraine (they do)."
liberal,"For Trump, the Burden May Be Proving This Is Not the Moment His Critics Predicted
The president and his allies dismiss the criticism about his Iran actions as partisan blowback from political adversaries too timid to take strong action against foreign enemies.
WASHINGTON — For three years, President Trump’s critics have expressed concern over how he would handle a genuine international crisis, warning that a commander in chief known for impulsive action might overreach with dangerous consequences.
In the angry and frenzied aftermath of the American drone strike that killed Iran’s top general, with vows of revenge hanging in the air, Mr. Trump confronts a decisive moment that will test whether those critics were right or whether they misjudged him.
“The moment we all feared is likely upon us,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter over the weekend. “An unstable President in way over his head, panicking, with all his experienced advisers having quit, and only the sycophantic amateurs remaining. Assassinating foreign leaders, announcing plans to bomb civilians. A nightmare.”

Mr. Trump’s advisers and allies dismissed the criticism as the predictable partisan blowback from political adversaries too timid to take strong action against foreign enemies who have targeted Americans for years with impunity. And some of Mr. Trump’s senior lieutenants were betting that any Iranian response proves less than meets the eye.
 “It may be that there’s a little noise here in the interim, that the Iranians make the choice to respond,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” as he made the rounds of all five major television news talk shows. “I hope that they don’t. President Trump has made clear what we will do in response if they do, that our response will be decisive and vigorous.”

But the ripple effects from the drone strike in Baghdad that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the visiting commander of Iran’s elite security and intelligence forces, were playing out in rapid succession on Sunday. Iraq’s Parliament voted to expel American forces from the country for violating its sovereignty. Iran declared that it was abandoning some constraints on its nuclear program. And the American military halted operations against the Islamic State to focus on protecting itself from Iranian retaliation.
The result is a situation as volatile as it has been at any point in many years, one that will challenge an instinctive, combative and relatively inexperienced commander in chief to navigate his way through a perilous period without making the kind of mistake he has accused his predecessors of making. And he faces enormous skepticism from the critics who have long warned that he was too erratic to face moments of crisis.
The massive demonstrations and calls for retaliation in the region ultimately may not add up to more than “a little noise,” as Mr. Pompeo asserted. The Iraqi parliamentary vote to force American troops to leave was nonbinding and the caretaker government may not follow through if only to preserve a hedge against Iranian dominance. Even as Tehran vowed to move ahead with its nuclear program, it kept its options open by not expelling international inspectors.
And some experts on the region suggested that Mr. Trump’s very unpredictability was a deterrent in itself, arguing that the killing of General Suleimani may have been so brazen and shocking to Iranian leaders that they will be wary of provoking an American president evidently willing to escalate in ways his predecessors were not.
“Trump actually has a very strong hand vis-à-vis the clerical regime,” said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former C.I.A. specialist on Iran at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an organization that has rallied opposition to Iran’s government. “Whether he chooses to play it, I don’t know. He’s not a strategist. But his tactical game hasn’t been bad. The hit on Suleimani was genius — totally flummoxed his opponent.”

But these are high-risk gambles with much at stake.
For the moment, the United States faces a dramatic break with Iraq, a country it has deeply invested in for nearly 17 years, and hard-liners in Tehran have consolidated their domestic position by capitalizing on anger at America. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, may not immediately mount a response, but it is widely assumed that he will act at some point, whether through violence or cyber means.
“When that response occurs, and depending on what it is, the ball will be squarely back in Trump’s court, presenting him with an equally fateful decision,” said Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama. “Does he escalate further, as he has warned, and risk a far longer, bloodier and costlier military confrontation? Or does he seek an off ramp?”
Mr. Trump has said he took out General Suleimani, whose forces have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops over the years, not to start a war but to stop one; his advisers asserted, without providing evidence, that the Iranian commander was plotting an “imminent” attack. At the same time, the president has ratcheted up his talk of war, vowing to respond to any Iranian provocations with overwhelming force, including strikes at Iranian cultural sites that some experts said would amount to a war crime.
He did not retreat from that on Sunday. “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site?” he told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One as he returned to Washington after his holidays in Florida. “It doesn’t work that way.”
Warming to the conflict, he even said he was ready to escalate against Iraq, the country America has worked so hard to stand up as a key ally in the region, threatening “very big sanctions” if it expels American troops.
“We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it,” he said of an air base in Iraq. “If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.”
A longer, bloodier and costlier military confrontation in the Middle East is not what Mr. Trump forecast when he won the presidency in 2016 nor what he seemed to offer since taking office. Throughout the campaign, he promised to extricate the United States from a geopolitical viper’s nest that has cost so many lives and so much treasure and as late as Sunday, he repeated his conclusion that “going into the Middle East was the worst decision ever made in the history of our country.”
But many of his policy pronouncements on the campaign trail and since were vague and at times contradictory, allowing different voters to hear what they wanted.
As a candidate, he repeatedly called for an end to Middle East engagements, while also saying at other times that he might need as many as 30,000 troops in the region to defeat the Islamic State. He excoriated President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq while declaring himself a fan of that administration’s interrogation techniques, at one point declaring, “Torture works.”
Michael Doran, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who previously served in the State and Defense Departments and on the National Security Council staff, said Mr. Trump’s decision to kill General Suleimani represented “a partial evolution” for a president who denounced “endless wars.”
Where Mr. Trump may once have seen a clash with Iran as an opportunity to negotiate a better nuclear agreement than Mr. Obama did, he now sees an inextricable connection to Tehran’s malign actions in the region, fomenting wars and supporting terrorists, Mr. Doran said.
“But he is also more keenly aware of the power differential between us and the Iranians,” Mr. Doran said. “Once he realized that Khamenei thought Suleimani gave him a competitive advantage, Trump simply took Suleimani off the board. With a drone, not an invasion force.”
In scrambling the equation, Mr. Trump took the initiative, not as Mr. Bush or Mr. Obama did in their own very different ways, but in classic Trumpian fashion, keeping everyone off balance, projecting toughness and gambling that he will be able to handle whatever comes next."
liberal,"Fox Host’s ‘America First’ Shift Makes an Exception for Trump’s Iran Strike
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/us/politics/pete-hegseth-trump-fox-news.html
The transformation of Pete Hegseth — an Ivy League-educated, decorated Army platoon leader — is a symbol of the Republican Party in the Trump era.
WASHINGTON — Immediately after President Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, some of the loudest applause was heard from Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a decorated veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
“He’s a terrorist who has killed Americans. We knew where he was and the president took a bold move to get rid of him, and people around the globe are thankful for that,” Mr. Hegseth said on the set of “Fox & Friends,” a perch he often takes to validate — and at times influence — Mr. Trump’s military policies.
That was the same Mr. Hegseth who has defended the president’s cozy interactions with Kim Jong-un, embraced Mr. Trump’s “America first” agenda of withdrawing forces abroad — and reversing interventionist policies he labeled irresolute and shameful — and energetically taken up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes.
But at no point during Mr. Trump’s presidency has Mr. Hegseth loomed larger, with the United States on a war footing and the next step unknown. Among the president’s unofficial policy advisers and those who add to the echo chamber on Fox News talk shows, no one else channels Mr. Trump’s mix of avowed isolationism, impulsive interventionism and unexpected resort to force.
 “If I was part of shaping the narrative” concerning the strike on General Suleimani, Mr. Hegseth said in a telephone interview on Monday, “well, that’s a wonderful part of my day job.”
Mr. Hegseth’s views, which have greatly evolved since his time in the Army and his tenure leading two conservative veterans organizations, are emblematic of the seismic shift among many Republicans under Mr. Trump on long-held foreign policy positions. They also reflect a slow but significant souring among veterans on the post-9/11 conflicts that many believe have cost the nation too much in lives and money.
“I think a lot of us who were very hawkish and believe in American military might and strength were very resistant to how candidate Trump characterized the wars,” Mr. Hegseth said in another recent telephone interview. “But if we are honest with ourselves, there is no doubt that we need to radically reorient how we do it. How much money have we invested, how many lives have we invested and has it actually made us safer? Is it still worth it?”
Mr. Hegseth’s influence was most pronounced late last year when he lobbied heavily on behalf of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a member of the Navy SEALs who was acquitted of serious war crimes. Mr. Trump reversed a demotion ordered as punishment, and then fired the secretary of the Navy, whom Mr. Hegseth had aggressively criticized.
Mr. Hegseth took to Fox News in November to defend Chief Gallagher. “From the beginning, this was overzealous prosecutors who were not giving the benefit of the doubt to the trigger pullers,” he said.
He spoke to Mr. Trump several times about the case. Mr. Trump subsequently tagged Mr. Hegseth in tweets on the issue, a public confirmation of his interactions with the president.
Having been successful in the Gallagher case, Mr. Hegseth has now taken up the cause of winning pardons for the Blackwater security contractors who were found guilty in the 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis in Baghdad.
Mr. Hegseth’s shift has alienated some longtime allies.
“I respect his service,” said William Kristol, a conservative analyst and former mentor to Mr. Hegseth. “I knew him 10 years ago and hoped he would be one of many leaders of that generation for strong American policy. But he has now apologized for war crimes and is a demagogue for Trump.”
Mr. Hegseth’s rallying around Mr. Trump’s order to attack General Suleimani has turned off some opponents of the “forever wars” who see opportunism. Voices like Tucker Carlson, another Fox host who has become strongly antiwar, and Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that Mr. Hegseth once led, have remained true to their war fatigue. Not Mr. Hegseth.
“I have been debating Pete Hegseth for 12 years, and I can’t tell you what he stands for other than himself and his own ambition,” said Jon Soltz, who served as an Army officer in the Iraq war and is a founder of VoteVets, a liberal group that advocates for veterans.
In 2009, Mr. Hegseth defended the surge in Afghanistan in repeated debates with Mr. Soltz, who was a critic of President Barack Obama and warned at the time that Iran was becoming empowered in Iraq.
 “I don’t share the concern that President Trump is dragging us into endless war here,” Mr. Hegseth said. “In fact, I hate the term ‘endless war’ as it pertains to Iran.”
The transformation of Mr. Hegseth — an Ivy League-educated, decorated Army platoon leader and former ally of Senator John McCain — from fierce advocate of militarism abroad to passionate Trumpist trumpet is a symbol of the Republican Party in the Trump era.
Scores of buttoned-up, Russia-deploring free traders with a deep reserve of tolerance for military involvements abroad have cast aside core beliefs to embrace Mr. Trump, their new personas validated and amplified by the heavily groomed, assembled supporters on the Fox set, where Mr. Hegseth now sits.
He has scored the rare dual posts of cable star and unofficial Trump adviser; Mr. Trump considered him for the jobs of White House press secretary and secretary of veterans affairs.
Mr. Hegseth, a Minnesota native, graduated from Princeton University, where he was the publisher of The Princeton Tory, a conservative magazine for which he wrote about seeing the statue of Saddam Hussein toppled in Baghdad. “Conservative ideas have worked, do work and will continue to work,” he concluded. “The list is long: A strong military is absolutely essential to bringing long-term peace and stability to the world.”
After earning his Army commission via Princeton’s Reserve Officers Training Corps, he served with a National Guard unit guarding detainees at Guantánamo Bay in 2004 and 2005.
 “He was a highly disciplined, highly focused, very intelligent officer and soldier who was really committed to serving his country,” said Ziad Shehady, who served with Mr. Hegseth.
In 2005, Mr. Hegseth volunteered to deploy to Iraq and was assigned to the Third Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division. There, Mr. Hegseth served under Col. Michael D. Steele, a hard-charging Army Ranger officer who was part of the Black Hawk Down episode in Somalia, a leader devoted to aggressive tactics to ferret out and kill suspected terrorist operatives, recorded on “kill boards” on base.
After Mr. Hegseth left, Colonel Steele oversaw Operation Iron Triangle, after which three American soldiers were convicted of murder for killing Iraqi prisoners. Colonel Steele was formally reprimanded but did not face charges.
“On that tour my eyes were open,” Mr. Hegseth said. “I was exposed to the reality of human nature, a vicious enemy, and I was forged and taught by these incredible patriots and warriors.”
Colonel Steele “understood the warrior ethos was very real,” Mr. Hegseth said, and under his command, he learned that “you subdue violence with violence.”
The experience helped shape his views of men accused of war crimes, said Mr. Hegseth, who has advised that “guys who make tough choices on the battlefield be given the benefit of the doubt.”
Pentagon and military leaders have said that Mr. Trump’s decisions could greatly reduce their ability to enforce discipline and could weaken the chain of command among the 1.3 million Americans on active duty.
Mr. Hegseth vehemently disagreed with that view, his single flash of anger during a lengthy interview. “You can maintain good order and discipline without throwing warriors under the bus,” he said, adding, “I think most of these characterizations are made by people who have never been in the type of situation that Gallagher has been in.”
If endorsing strong-arm tactics while opposing a conservative military strategy seems complicated, that is the new normal under Mr. Trump.
“When you get caught up in a movement, sometimes you promote things that make emotional sense at the moment but don’t really make any sense overall,” said Wade Zirkle, a Denver businessman and veteran who founded the pro-interventionist Vets for Freedom, then recruited Mr. Hegseth to take over.
Mr. Zirkle credits Mr. Hegseth with raising money and the organization’s profile but was surprised by his populist turn. “He is enabling the president who has no respect for the military or respect for U.S. alliances abroad,” Mr. Zirkle said.
After Mr. Obama announced the Afghanistan troop increase, Mr. Hegseth volunteered to deploy to Kabul in 2011 and 2012. As a senior counterinsurgency instructor, “I saw the clear disconnect between our strategy and reality,” he said. “We were selling a connect-with-the-locals message even though we knew that was not working.”
Mr. Hegseth left the military early to run for the Senate in Minnesota but withdrew when he lost ground to a Tea Party candidate who then lost the general election. He earned a master’s degree in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, then became the leader of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with ties to Charles Koch that has also been influential on Mr. Trump’s views of veterans health care.
Mr. Hegseth found the president’s ear and more attention from Fox News bookers. “It was never my intention to forge a relationship” with the president, he said. “I know that I have learned a great deal from the truths he has told, his courage on these issues to speak plainly and truly about topics that are usually spoken about in code.”
Over the last year, Mr. Hegseth has seemed to move further and further from the bookish veteran of his initial television appearances. He was recently banned from Twitter — where he has expressed support for the conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer’s congressional campaign and retweeted the cartoonist Ben Garrison, who has been called anti-Semitic — for posting part of a manifesto written by a Saudi aviation student who killed three people at Naval Air Station Pensacola.
Mr. Hegseth has also earned criticism with some of his Fox commentary supporting Mr. Trump’s more incendiary moments. He defended the president’s comments after the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Va., during which a white nationalist killed a protester by crashing his car into the crowd.
“There’s a reason those people were out there,” he said. “Some of it is outright racism and needs to be condemned. A lot of it, though, is I feel like my country is slipping away and just because I talk about nationalism, not white nationalism, doesn’t mean I’m talking in code, that I’m a racist.”
Despite his criticism of many conflicts overseas, Mr. Hegseth recently rejoined the Army as a commissioned major in the National Guard in Washington. From there, he could face deployment to a conflict with Iran.
 “We are in a generational struggle against radical Islam,” he said.
“I wouldn’t put my views in a libertarian box or neocon box,” he concluded. “I believe in putting America first.”"
liberal,"Trump Threatens Iranian Cultural Sites, and Warns of Sanctions on Iraq
The president threatened Iran over potential retaliation for the death of a top general, and Iraq over the potential expulsion of United States troops.
WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday evening doubled down on his claim that he would target Iranian cultural sites if Iran retaliated for the targeted killing of one of its top generals, and threatened “very big sanctions” on Iraq if American troops are forced to leave the country.
Aboard Air Force One on his way back from his holiday trip to Florida, Mr. Trump reiterated to reporters the spirit of a Twitter post on Saturday, when he said the United States government had identified 52 sites for retaliation against Iran if there were a response to Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani’s death. Some, he tweeted, were of “cultural” significance.
Such a move could be considered a war crime under international laws, but Mr. Trump said Sunday that he was undeterred.
“They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people,” the president said. “And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way.”
The remarks came just hours after the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, walked back Mr. Trump’s tweets and said that whatever was done in any military engagement with Iran would be within the bounds of the law.
Mr. Trump also sounded fatalistic about the possibility of an Iranian escalation.
“If it happens, it happens,” he said. “If they do anything, there will be major retaliation”
As the president spoke, six advisers crowded to the side of Mr. Trump’s desk in the cabin, near the doorway: Robert O’Brien, his national security adviser; Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser; Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Hogan Gidley, a deputy press secretary; and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director. The president had a football game on the television affixed to the wall.
Mr. Trump also vowed to impose sanctions on Iraq if a move to evict American military personnel from the country takes place, a possibility heightened by the Iraqi Parliament’s passage Sunday of a measure to expel foreign troops in response to the killing of General Suleimani. That strike took place in Iraq, in a move that officials saw as violating the country’s sovereignty.
 “We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there,” Mr. Trump said of Iraq. “It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.”
Mr. Trump then escalated his language, saying: “If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.”
“If there’s any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq,” Mr. Trump added.
In making his warning, the president was threatening sanctions on a country for forcing out American troops whom he himself had pledged to bring home during his 2016 presidential campaign.
The threat also underscored the growing fallout from the president’s decision regarding General Suleimani.
The president said in tweets and in a statement on Friday about the strike that General Suleimani’s “reign of terror” was over, and he spoke about the hundreds of deaths for which the commander was responsible.
Officials have said the United States was retaliating against Iran, first for the death of an American contractor, and then for attacks at the American Embassy in Iraq led by pro-Iranian forces.
Officials have also said they had intelligence that General Suleimani was involved in planning “imminent” attacks on American interests in other countries, a statement that some government officials have questioned.
Mr. Trump told reporters that he might discuss making some of the intelligence available to a skeptical public nearly 17 years after the war in Iraq began on the basis of intelligence that proved not to be credible.
Mr. Trump also insisted he had been personally tracking General Suleimani for about 18 months. “He was leading his country down a very bad, dangerous path,” he said."
liberal,"A Typical Trump Vacation, With a Momentous Result
For three years, President Trump’s winter visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private club, have allowed him time to combine his personal and presidential business. But the juxtaposition this year was something quite different.
PALM BEACH, Fla. — Beneath wind-swept palm trees and gilded chandeliers, President Trump dined with Rush Limbaugh and congratulated Keith Hernandez, the Mets announcer and former first baseman, on his wedding. He consulted with his national security and campaign advisers while basking in 80-degree weather, and, as always, he tweeted.
He also authorized a military strike that has roiled the Middle East and is likely to endure as one of the most consequential acts of his presidency.
For three years, Mr. Trump’s winter visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private club, have allowed him time to combine his personal and presidential business, often in the midst of the club’s wealthy members and his adoring friends.
But the jarring juxtapositions this year seemed to highlight some central elements in the way Mr. Trump has governed: the little interest he has in planning beyond the day in front of him, his need for positive feedback and an unwillingness to modulate his behavior, whatever the circumstance.
From the outside, the president’s two-week winter vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., seemed similar to his previous long stays, except for the fact that he had recently been impeached.
The days were generally marked by casual-wear trips to his nearby golf club, where he would talk with members and meet with White House advisers. The evenings were marked by elaborate dinners at Mar-a-Lago that included his family members, his campaign advisers and his national security aides.
But Mr. Trump’s vacation was more than the usual refuge from negative news coverage and official Washington. He was agitated by uncertainty about what comes next in the impeachment process, and expressed gnawing concerns about how much the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg is spending on his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in the election that Mr. Trump hopes to win.
Throughout Christmas week, the president watched the news coverage on impeachment and tweeted his frustrations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi for slowing down the process by refusing to send to the Senate the articles charging him with high crimes and misdemeanors. He spoke with advisers about what the Senate trial might look like.
And there were other grievances, as well.
On Sunday, Dec. 29, hours after a stabbing at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, N.Y., Mr. Trump, from his golf club in West Palm Beach, called one of his oldest acquaintances and major Jewish supporters, the cosmetics billionaire Ronald S. Lauder, to yell that Mr. Lauder should be doing more to “support” him, according to three people briefed on the call.
Mr. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress who recently started a new $25 million effort to fight anti-Semitism that employs a pollster working for Mr. Bloomberg, listened as Mr. Trump ticked off a litany of administration actions. Mr. Trump said that he had done more for Jews than any other president and that he could still lose the Jewish vote. The president never mentioned campaign contributions, but advisers and others briefed on the call said he left the clear impression that was referring to financial support.
In a statement, Mr. Lauder would say only that he has had “many candid, positive and forward-looking conversations with” Mr. Trump, who “deserves a great deal of support from the Jewish community for his fantastic record on Israel and his proven support of the Jewish people here at home.”
Then it was time to get back to White House work, and Mr. Trump huddled with advisers offering him a range of options on how to respond to the death of an American civilian contractor killed on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base. The menu of choices included the most extreme one — killing Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s most powerful commander.
On New Year’s Eve, Mr. Trump hosted his annual party at Mar-a-Lago, arriving in a tuxedo with the first lady, Melania Trump, and playing M.C. to a crowd that included his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.
On Jan. 2, the president began his day at his golf club. But mindful of not appearing weak in the face the rocket attack and concerned that an assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad that United States officials said was orchestrated by Iran could have ended in devastation, Mr. Trump had already settled on a course of action.
In the middle of a meeting with campaign advisers, he left the table to give the final authorization to kill General Suleimani. The president then returned, and, compartmentalizing what had just happened, resumed talking about the campaign.
It was an act of enormous consequence, but the White House made no public statement for hours, though the president cryptically tweeted about what had taken place. Whatever the administration’s objectives were, and whatever intelligence they had used to justify the strike, it was not being shared in any conventional fashion.
Mr. Trump closely monitored reactions to his military action, taking note of who praised him publicly among Republicans and who did not, like Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host. He was encouraged by others on the Trump-friendly network.
But finally, on Friday afternoon, as he was about leave on a short helicopter ride to Miami for a campaign event with evangelical supporters, he abruptly agreed to make a statement on the strike.
His decision to speak came partly at the prodding of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had jumped in to try to direct the public response.
So aides draped one of the private dining rooms at Mar-a-Lago with a presidential blue cloth as a backdrop to the presidential podium. Roughly five minutes after he started talking, Mr. Trump was done.
Next up was Miami, and there, at the King Jesus International Ministry, he excoriated the “fake news,” declared from the dais that two progressive congresswomen “hate” Jewish people, taunted the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for his faith, and said God was “on our side.”
The president’s final day of vacation, Saturday, was spent at the golf club, and was punctuated by a handful of tweets.
That night, Mr. Trump strolled through Mar-a-Lago, a phalanx of aides in tow, as Mr. Hernandez got married in an adjacent room, according to attendees. The president did not attend the wedding, but did offer congratulations."
liberal,"In Miami Speech, Trump Tells Evangelical Base: God Is ‘on Our Side’
President Trump, who has been gripped by anxiety about evangelical voters abandoning him, took wide swipes at Democratic rivals one day after the strike on a top Iranian leader.
— In his first public appearance since the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, President Trump rallied his evangelical Christian base of supporters on Friday, portraying himself as the restorer of faith in the public square and claiming that God is “on our side.”
Mr. Trump brought to the stage Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the founder of Christianity Today, to offer an implicit rebuke of the magazine’s recent editorial calling for his removal from the White House.
Ms. Lynch’s appearance underscored how sensitive Mr. Trump was about any signs of fracturing in his base; many evangelical allies denounced the editorial, and Ms. Graham Lynch vowed on Friday to help Mr. Trump win re-election. She then welcomed a supporter to the stage who told attendees that they could not trust what the news media wrote about the president.
Mentioning the attack in Baghdad only briefly, the president spent his hourlong speech at Ministerio Internacional El Rey Jesús, a church with a predominantly Hispanic congregation, alternating between his familiar mocking jabs at Democrats, who he repeatedly called anti-religious, and boasting about his own faith-based policies. Saying he would renew the importance of religion and family, Mr. Trump vowed that he would toughen restrictions on abortion and would take action to “safeguard students and teachers’ First Amendment rights to pray in our schools.”
In remarks highlighting his support for Israel, Mr. Trump also attacked Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
“Where do these people come from?” Mr. Trump said. “These people hate Israel. They hate Jewish people.”
Mr. Trump’s comments were repeatedly met with enthusiastic cheers and chants of “four more years” from the crowded and sprawling church.
“Evangelical Christians of every denomination and believers of every faith have never had a greater champion, not even close, in the White House, than you have right now,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve done things that nobody thought was possible. Together we’re not only defending our constitutional rights. We’re also defending religion itself, which is under siege.”
Mr. Trump began his remarks by mentioning the killing of General Suleimani and praising the military, on a day when many Democratic officials and presidential candidates have questioned the president’s decision to order the strike and whether he has a broader strategy to deal with potential reprisals from Iran.
Mr. Trump excited the crowd by repeatedly thanking them for their crucial support in 2016 and promising that “we’re going to blow those numbers away in 2020.”
Mr. Trump, who rarely made church visits in the 2016 presidential campaign and once mistook the plate offering communion for the collection plate, was described by his favorite pastor and current White House aide, Paula White, as a man of God who is “loyal to a T.”
He again taunted Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts by referring to her as “Pocahontas” and mocked Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has spoken frequently about his faith, by claiming he had become religious just “two weeks ago.”
“We can’t let one of our radical left friends come in here because everything we’ve done will be gone in short order,” he said. “They can take it away pretty quickly.”
Mr. Buttigieg, responding to a reporter’s question on Saturday after a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., needled Mr. Trump for his “interest in my faith journey.”
“Certainly it’s been a complex journey for me, as it is for a lot of people. But I’m pretty sure I’ve been a believer longer than he’s been a Republican,” Mr. Buttigieg said.
The event had been planned for several weeks, as an opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump's support from a group of voters who were critical to his victory in 2016.
Mr. Trump has been gripped by anxiety over evangelical voters abandoning him since soon after he took office. He has repeatedly tried to shore up his connection to evangelicals throughout his first term, repeatedly pointing to his move to fill dozens of open federal judicial posts with conservative jurists.
Mr. Trump was surprised when the publication Christianity Today wrote an editorial calling for his removal from office amid the House impeachment inquiry. Roughly 200 evangelicals wrote a letter denouncing the editorial — and several evangelical leaders said it did not reflect a majority view among their voters.
Still, Mr. Trump was troubled by it, according to people close to him.
Outside the rally, supporters said they came to offer their unblinking support for the president. In a city where Hispanics make up 70 percent of the population, many supporters chatted with one another in Spanish as they waited for hours in the blazing Miami sun. The leader of the church, Guillermo Maldonado, made headlines last week when he promised the largely immigrant congregation that undocumented immigrants would not face deportation if they attended the event.
“He’s talking from his heart,” said Michelle Hoff, who came to the rally with two other women from her prayer group. “I can’t remember when we had a president who was honest like he is. Like everyone else, he’s a sinner saved by grace. A lot of people say stuff that they don’t do. He’s doing it.”
Asked if she opposed anything the president said or did, Ms. Hoff said that she only wished he would appoint judges to fully overturn Roe v. Wade and same-sex marriage.
The rally inside the massive church began with energetic Christian rock, with many supporters clad in red MAGA hats dancing and lifting their hands in prayer.
Though all of the invited speakers were popular evangelical leaders and entertainers, many supporters outside were Cuban émigrés who said their primary concern was what they saw as the threat of socialism. Most said they were lifelong Republicans who were more concerned than ever about the Democratic Party gaining more power, citing fears that they would face more government mandates.
“America stands for itself,” said Belkis Gonzalez, 57, a teacher who emigrated from Cuba three decades ago and wore a T-shirt emblazoned with “Socialism sucks,” styled similarly to the logo for Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign. “We are no longer giving money and free support to enemies of America and instead take strong action. We’re not flaky and shaky anymore.”

liberal,"Trump Pulls Back Efforts to Enforce Housing Desegregation
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, hoping to lower housing costs, will propose new rules that reverse Obama-era efforts to desegregate housing.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to propose pulling back Obama-era efforts to desegregate housing, saying that people should have the opportunity to live where they want as long as they are protected from discrimination and housing is affordable.
The Obama administration argued that in order to fulfill the Fair Housing Act of 1968, states, local governments and public housing agencies had to address disparities in housing, integrate neighborhoods and transform racially concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity.
An Obama-era rule pressed state and local governments and public housing agencies to collect local and regional data on patterns of integration and segregation, and use it to promote fair housing and equal opportunity.
The Trump administration plans to propose a rule next week that will pull back those guidelines, arguing that they are onerous and actually holding back the construction of affordable housing. “Fair housing choice,” the new proposal says, is ensuring that people have the opportunity and option to live “where they choose” as long as there is no “unlawful discrimination.”
Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, said in August 2018 that the current rule, “which was designed to expand affordable housing choices, is actually suffocating investment in some of our most distressed neighborhoods that need our investment the most.”
Fair housing experts worry that the Trump administration is merely trying to get the Department of Housing and Urban Development out of civil rights enforcement.
If the rule is finalized, “ongoing housing discrimination and segregation will likely continue to be swept under the rug and HUD resources will do far less to reduce segregation and expand housing opportunities” for protected groups, said Peggy Bailey, the vice president for housing policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The housing department has not released its annual fair housing report since 2017, but the National Fair Housing Alliance found that the number of housing discrimination complaints rose 8 percent in 2018 over 2017, the highest increase since 1995.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the proposed rule after The Washington Post published its account. The housing department did not respond to requests for comment on the proposed rule.
The proposed rule comes as the nation’s biggest cities are trying to cope with housing crises and as homelessness rates have increased, especially on the West Coast. Black homeownership rates have declined to levels not seen since the 1960s. The department has already proposed a rule that would raise the bar for proving housing discrimination. The public comment period for that rule closed last August, and it is still under consideration.
The Fair Housing Act requires that recipients of HUD funding “affirmatively further” fair housing and equal opportunity but leaves it to the secretary of housing and urban development to decide what that means.
The Obama administration defined furthering fair housing as addressing “significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.”
The Trump administration would drastically pare that back to simply saying people should live “where they choose, within their means, without unlawful discrimination related to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability.” No mention of segregation appears in the new definition.
The 2015 Obama rule required recipients of HUD funding to work with the agency to assess the state of fair housing in their community. The recipients were then required to create fair housing goals. The Obama administration estimated that the rule would cost local entities $25 million a year and HUD $9 million annually.
Housing advocates saw that as money well spent.
“After several years of considerable input from stakeholders across the spectrum, the Obama administration’s fair housing rule made the strongest effort in decades to reverse harmful patterns of segregation and discriminatory practices in communities across the country,” Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement.
The proposed rule would change how the housing department evaluates whether local governments and housing agencies are advancing its fair housing goals. Under the rule, local governments would be evaluated based on whether they have been sued by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development or Justice and whether they have provided an adequate supply of quality affordable housing. Fair housing lawsuits by advocacy organizations like the National Fair Housing Alliance would not count against the local entities.
Localities would be free to come up with their own goals to address housing discrimination.
“This approach would allow jurisdictions to act as they deem necessary to achieve their results while allowing HUD to avoid micromanaging localities,” the proposed rule says.
The proposed rule also lists 17 obstacles that jurisdictions can choose to address, like wetland or environmental regulations, but those do not include racial discrimination.
Conservative housing experts agreed with the new direction.
“Too often, government mandates, restrictions and subsidies fuel rising costs,” said Joel Griffith, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “On the state level, onerous restrictions on zoning — and on environmental regulations — can add dramatically to the costs of housing,”
Advocates for fair housing say that focusing on the supply and quality of housing does not mean that racial minorities and other groups in the protected classes under the Fair Housing Act actually have access to the housing stock that is there. Nearly all of the obstacles listed in the proposed rule are focused on the supply of housing, not barriers to obtaining it.
There will be a 60-day public comment period once the rule is proposed. The department will have to consider the comments before finalizing the rule.
The latest proposal joins three other proposed rules that have elicited criticism from housing advocates. In addition to one that would raise the bar for proving housing discrimination, another would bar families with undocumented immigrants from receiving housing assistance. The public comment period closed last July, and over 30,000 public comments were submitted. The department must consider those comments before completing the rule. The other would weaken legal protections for transgender people in homeless shelters."
liberal,"Impeachment Impasse Deepens in Senate, Leaving Trump’s Trial in Doubt
On the first day of a new legislative session, Senate leaders indicated they had made no progress in resolving their logjam over how to proceed.
WASHINGTON — Senate leaders wrangled on Friday over the terms of President Trump’s impeachment trial, deepening their impasse and throwing the start date further into doubt amid disputes over whether to call witnesses or introduce documentary evidence.
In a pair of barbed back-to-back speeches on the Senate floor, the top Republican and the top Democrat traded charges of hypocrisy and unfair dealing, settling nothing in the high-stakes fight over the shape of the constitutional proceeding that will decide Mr. Trump’s fate.
The feuding on the first day of a new legislative session indicated that two weeks of holiday respite had done little to break a logjam that began late last year when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she would not transmit two impeachment articles approved by the Democratic-led House to prompt the start of a trial until the Senate agreed to a fair process.
“Their turn is over,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Friday of House Democrats. “They have done enough damage. It is the Senate’s turn now to render sober judgment as the framers envisioned.”
But with no direct negotiations between the Senate leaders scheduled, nor any indication of when Ms. Pelosi might send the articles, lawmakers and aides privately warned that the stalemate could stretch into mid-January, with Mr. Trump’s presidency hanging in the balance.
Mr. McConnell, conceding that his chamber could not proceed to a trial without the House acting first, said the Senate would simply turn back to their regular legislative work while they waited, “content to continue the ordinary business of the Senate while House Democrats continue to flounder.”
Stepping onto the Senate floor moments after Mr. McConnell, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused the president’s party of trying to steamroll to his acquittal.
“We are not asking for critics of the president to serve as witnesses in the trial,” Mr. Schumer said. “We are asking only that the president’s men, his top advisers, tell their side of the story. And Leader McConnell has been unable to make one argument — one single argument — as to why these witnesses and these documents should not be part of a trial.”
In her own written statement, Ms. Pelosi went a step further, accusing Mr. McConnell of violating the oath that all senators must take in an impeachment trial to “do impartial justice,” and of ignoring wrongdoing by the president.
 “Today, Leader McConnell made clear that he will feebly comply with President Trump’s cover-up of his abuses of power and be an accomplice to that cover-up,” she wrote.
The outcome of the dispute over witnesses and documents could determine not only when the trial begins and how long it lasts, but also whether it produces meaningful new information that could affect the outcome, either exonerating or further implicating Mr. Trump.
The House impeached the president last month after an inquiry that exposed how Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., while withholding nearly $400 million in military assistance that Kyiv needed to beat back lethal Russian aggression. Democrats charged that the conduct amounted to an effort by the president to enlist a foreign power to help him in the 2020 election, using the tools of United States foreign policy and American taxpayer dollars as leverage.
House Republicans contended that Mr. Trump was merely trying to root out corruption in a former Soviet republic that had long been known for it, though they contested few of the facts drawn out by weeks of testimony in the House.
Ms. Pelosi and Senate Democrats have subsequently argued that in light of Mr. Trump’s blanket defiance of the House’s impeachment inquiry, the trial must include new evidence to be fair, and they want a commitment up front.
Mr. Schumer has specifically asked that a trial include testimony from four witnesses who evaded the House and a wide array of documents that the White House blocked House investigators from obtaining.
His case has been aided in recent days as new evidence has surfaced in news reports and freedom of information lawsuits. Democrats got another possible break on Friday, as Mr. Schumer was addressing the Senate, when a federal judge in New York ruled that Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s involved in elements of the Ukraine matter, could begin sharing additional documents and communications with the House.
Mr. McConnell vehemently disagrees, though on Friday he did not rule out calling witnesses. He asked instead for the Senate to follow the precedent of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, when lawmakers agreed unanimously to open the proceedings without an agreement on whether to call witnesses, and decided on that issue only after both sides presented opening arguments.
“Just like 20 years ago, we should address mid-trial questions such as witnesses after briefs, opening arguments, senator questions, and other relevant motions,” he said. “Fair is fair.”
Negotiations may only become more complicated in the days ahead, as Washington also contends with the aftermath of an American drone strike early Friday that killed Iran’s top security and intelligence commander. The commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, led the powerful Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and with Iran already promising retaliation, the action ordered by Mr. Trump threatened to escalate a dangerous conflict in the region.
The drone strike at Baghdad International Airport drew comparisons to Mr. Clinton’s four-day bombing campaign of Iraq in December 1998 as he stared down his own impeachment. At the time, some Republicans accused the president of using a military incursion to distract from his domestic political problems.
Mr. Trump has made little secret of his eagerness for the Republican-controlled Senate to mount an elaborate trial that would not only dispense with the charges, but also provide an opportunity for his allies to defend him, and Ms. Pelosi believes that withholding the impeachment charges could provide leverage in shaping the trial before it begins.
In his floor speech on Friday, Mr. McConnell emphatically rejected that strategy. He denounced Democrats in both the House and Senate for degrading the impeachment process with what he called a historically weak case. Calling additional witnesses during a Senate trial, as Democrats have demanded, would not change that, he said.
“The same people who just spent weeks screaming that impeachment was so serious and so urgent that it couldn’t wait for due process now decided it would wait indefinitely while they checked the political whims and looked for new talking points,” Mr. McConnell said.
While Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he was being denied due process rights in the House impeachment proceeding, the White House refused to participate when offered the opportunity.
Mr. McConnell vociferously defended himself against Democratic charges that he was unfairly prejudging the case and sought to turn the tables on Democrats, who he said were “openly coordinating political strategy with the speaker, who some might call the prosecution.”
Republicans hope to make Democrats pay politically for the delay.
Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said he planned to introduce a resolution on Monday that would amend the Senate impeachment rules to allow the chamber to dismiss the House’s charges if Democrats did not promptly bring them to trial. The resolution’s constitutionality is questionable, and it is unlikely to receive a vote, but it drew attention to Republicans’ argument that Democrats were acting out of political interest.
“This will expose Dems’ circus for what it is: a fake impeachment, abuse of the Constitution, based on no evidence,” Mr. Hawley, a first-term lawmaker, wrote on Twitter. “If Dems won’t proceed with trial, bogus articles should be dismissed and @realDonaldTrump fully cleared.”
With Mr. McConnell firmly wedded to his position, Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi appealed to moderate Republican senators, perhaps their best hope for scrambling the current partisan dynamic. If Democrats remain united, they need only four Republicans to temporarily join them to command a majority able to set the rules of the trial."

liberal,"For Trump, a Risky Gamble to Deter Iran
The goal was to prove American resolve in the face of Iranian attacks. Now, American officials have no doubt the Iranians will respond — but they don’t know how quickly, or how furiously.
President Trump’s decision to strike and kill the second most powerful official in Iran turns a slow-simmering conflict with Tehran into a boiling one, and is the riskiest move made by the United States in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
The calculus was straightforward: Washington had to re-establish deterrence, and show the Iranian leadership that missiles fired at ships in the Persian Gulf and at oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, along with attacks inside Iraq that cost the life of an American contractor, would not go without a response.
But while senior American officials have no doubt the Iranians will respond, they do not know how quickly, or how furiously.
For a president who repeated his determination to withdraw from the caldron of the Middle East, the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who for two decades has led Iran’s most fearsome and ruthless military unit, the Quds Force, means there will be no escape from the region for the rest of his presidency, whether that is one year or five. Mr. Trump has committed the United States to a conflict whose dimensions are unknowable, as Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seeks vengeance.
 “This is a massive walk up the escalation ladder,” wrote Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute. “With Suleimani dead, war is coming — that seems certain, the only questions are where, in what form and when?”
Bruce Riedel, the former C.I.A. officer who spent his life studying the Middle East, and is now at the Brookings Institution, said, “The administration is taking America into another war in the Middle East, bigger than ever.”
Yet it may not be a conventional war in any sense, since the Iranians’ advantage is all in asymmetric conflict.

Their history suggests they will not take on the United States frontally. Iranians are the masters of striking soft targets, starting in Iraq, but hardly limited to that country. In the past few years, they have honed an ability to cause low-level chaos, and left no doubt that they want to be able to reach the United States.
For now, they cannot — at least in traditional ways.
But they have tried terrorism, including an abortive effort nine years ago to kill a Saudi ambassador in Washington, and late Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security was sending out reminders of Iran’s past and current efforts to attack the United States in cyberspace. Until now, that has been limited to breaches on American banks and scrutiny of dams and other critical infrastructure, but they so far have not shown they have the abilities of the Russians or the Chinese.
Their first escalation may well be in Iraq, where they back pro-Iranian militias. But even there, they are an unwelcome force. It was only a few weeks ago when people took to the streets in Iraq to protest Iranian, not American, interference in their politics. Still, there are soft targets throughout the region, as the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities showed.
Complicating the management of a perilous moment are the president’s impeachment and the revival of Iran’s nuclear program.
It is only a matter of time before there are questions about whether the strike was meant to create a counternarrative, one of a conflict with a longtime adversary, while a Senate trial to determine whether to remove Mr. Trump begins. And already there are charges that the president overstepped, and that the decision to kill General Suleimani — if it was a decision, and the Iranian leader was not simply in the wrong convoy at the wrong moment — required congressional approval.
“The question is this,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, asked on Twitter as news of the strike spread. “As reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?”
Mr. Trump will argue that he was well within his rights, and that the strike was an act of self-defense. And he will have a strong argument: General Suleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans in Iraq over the years, and doubtless was planning more.
The American announcement, from Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, cited the general’s plans — which were not specified — as a justification for the action. If there was real intelligence of impending strikes, then the longtime principles of pre-emption, enshrined anew in American policy by President George W. Bush, would apply.
The nuclear future is more complex.
Mr. Trump walked away from the 2015 nuclear agreement more than a year ago, over the objections of many of his own aides and almost all American allies.
At first, the Iranians reacted coolly, and stayed within the limits of the accord. That ended last year, as tensions escalated.
Before the strike, they were expected to announce, in the next week, their next nuclear move — and it seemed likely to be a move closer to enrichment of bomb-grade uranium. That seems far more likely now, and poses the possibility of the next escalation, if it prompts American or Israeli military or cyberaction against Iran’s known nuclear facilities.
Once it buries General Suleimani, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — which oversaw the secret projects to build nuclear weapons two decades ago — may well determine that it is time to surge ahead. There is little question the United States is far less likely to challenge a country with an existing nuclear arsenal. The Iranians, like the North Koreans and the Pakistanis, could well take General Suleimani’s death as a warning about what happens to countries with no nuclear options.
Even those critical of the president’s nuclear move said they understood why the Iranian general was such a target.
 “These guys are the personification of evil,” David H. Petraeus, the retired general who was an architect of the surge in Iraq, said in an interview Thursday night. “We calculated they were responsible for at least 600 deaths” of American soldiers.
But Mr. Petraeus offered a caution.
“There will be an escalation,” he said. “I assume they have to do something. And the only question is, over time, have we created more deterrence than if we had not acted.”"
liberal,"Biden Warns About Disinformation After Misleading Video
A day after a deceptively edited video of him spread on social media, Joseph R. Biden Jr. cautioned that the Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to false information in the general election.
ANAMOSA, Iowa — As the Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday to address voters still scarred by President Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to baseless criticism and disinformation in the general election.
Mr. Biden’s remarks in Iowa, at his first political event of the 2020 election year, came a day after a deceptive video of him circulated online, highlighting how campaigns are still struggling to combat false information on the internet.
“You’re going to see a lot more of not only my statements being taken out of context and lied about or altered, you’re going to see whomever the Democratic nominee is, because that’s how this guy operates,” Mr. Biden said, adding that Democratic candidates would face unfair attacks from Mr. Trump “if I were to drop out of the race tomorrow” or “if I were to drop dead tomorrow.” (There was no evidence that the video was connected to the president.)
Mr. Biden’s comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat Mr. Trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that Mr. Biden was making racist remarks. In fact he was emphasizing the need to change “our culture” around violence toward women.
Still, the video spread rapidly on social media, amplified by many right-wing verified users on Twitter, including reporters at conservative news outlets, the former speaker of the Missouri House and Republican strategists, according to data compiled by Vinesight, a company that detects disinformation on social media. It is an online environment that alarms many Democratic voters who are gripped by anxiety over how best to defeat Mr. Trump.
The president, who was impeached in the House of Representatives in connection with asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, is comfortable only in a “mosh pit,” said Mr. Biden, who has faced months of false or exaggerated attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.
Still, he argued that the Democratic Party was in a far stronger position today to confront Mr. Trump than in 2016, noting support for the president’s impeachment among some voters — “Hillary didn’t have that advantage” — and saying that in the previous campaign, not everyone took Mr. Trump seriously.
In response to the questioner, who also asked whether he was running a better campaign than Hillary Clinton had, Mr. Biden offered a wide-ranging answer and relitigated how Mrs. Clinton handled a debate after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging about making unsolicited sexual advances.
He suggested that Mrs. Clinton could have changed the subject, pivoting to how she hoped to change voters’ lives. Instead, Mr. Biden said, “she did what every other candidate probably would have done” by lacing into his character, yielding an ugly debate, and “it all went down the drain.” Yet before that debate even started, Mr. Trump had invited several women who had made allegations against former President Bill Clinton to join him for a photo opportunity.
Mr. Biden also noted sexism as he discussed the last campaign, which he called “unfair,” but added, “That’s not going to happen with me.”
It was not just Mr. Biden who was ruminating on the 2016 election on Thursday; Mrs. Clinton’s loss in the Electoral College was on the minds of other candidates as well as voters.
At a campaign office opening in Plymouth, N.H., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang told voters: “Donald Trump is our president today because he had a very simple message — he said he was going to ‘make America great again.’ What did Hillary Clinton say in response? ‘America is already great.’”
 “That did not quite work,” Mr. Yang said. “The problems are real. The struggles are real. Many Americans are being left behind. But Donald Trump’s solutions were not what we need.”
And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, campaigning at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., was asked by a voter whether she would work to unite the party around the Democratic nominee if it was not her. The voter noted how some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not rally behind Mrs. Clinton in the general election against Mr. Trump.
Ms. Warren began a lengthy answer by first committing to party unity: “Every single person who is in the race for the Democratic nomination for president would make a far better president than Donald Trump,” she said to applause.
“I’m in all the way,” she added, and started making the case for differences between the 2020 race and the 2016 campaign — chiefly, in her telling, the palpably greater determination and intensity among Democrats to beat Mr. Trump.
“What we have to remind ourselves is, 2020 is not 2016. The world has changed,” she said, recalling the protest marches after Mr. Trump’s inauguration and the Democratic victories in 2018 in the House of Representatives and key governorships, and in 2019 in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia.
“We are getting stronger and we are in this fight,” she said. “2020 gives us this remarkable moment that is very different from ’16 or ’12 or ’08 or however far you want to go back. This moment where Americans are off the sidelines.”
Saying that “the door is open a crack” to an era of major reforms and the end of “business as usual,” she added: “Think about it — a nation that elects someone like Donald Trump is a nation that has got serious problems. Going back is not where we want to be. Our chance in 2020 is to look at that crack, drop our shoulder, run hard at it and build the America we want to be.”
Asked for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, said, “Insulting half the country didn’t work for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it won’t work for the Democrats in 2020, either.”
Mr. Sanders, another leading progressive in the race, also waded into the debate over how to defeat Mr. Trump as he uncorked some of his fiercest criticism of Mr. Biden to date in an interview with The Washington Post.
“It’s just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign, which isn’t going to create energy and excitement,” Mr. Sanders said. “He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump.”
Mr. Sanders on Thursday reported an eye-popping fund-raising haul of more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to his campaign, ahead of Mr. Biden at $22.7 million — Mr. Biden’s strongest quarter to date — as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign reported more than $24.7 million.
Even as Mr. Sanders sharpened his attacks on Mr. Biden in the interview, he largely stuck to his familiar message on the trail in Iowa on Thursday, denouncing income inequality and championing his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.” At a canvass kickoff in Grinnell, he jokingly named a young girl as his running mate.
As he boarded his new campaign bus after that event, he briefly answered a question about his fourth-quarter fund-raising, calling attention specifically to the more than five million contributions his campaign had received since he entered the race. “That tells me the kind of grass-roots support that we have and tells me why we’re going to win the nomination and why we’re going to defeat Donald Trump,” he said.

liberal,"More Than 200 Republicans Urge Supreme Court to Weigh Overturning Roe v. Wade
Two House Democrats joined them in signing a legal brief in a case that is certain to inject the divisive politics of abortion into the 2020 presidential race.
 
WASHINGTON — More than 200 Republican members of Congress on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to consider overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established a woman’s right to an abortion, in a brief urging the justices to uphold a Louisiana law that severely restricts access to the procedure.
Roughly 80 percent of the Republicans in Congress — 39 senators and 166 House members — and two centrist House Democrats signed the amicus curiae, or “friend of the court,” brief in the case of June Medical Services L.L.C. v. Gee. They also asked the justices to consider overturning another landmark abortion ruling in the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey.
“The court has exercised that judgment to overrule precedent in over 230 cases throughout its history,” the lawmakers wrote. “Forty-six years after Roe was decided, it remains a radically unsettled precedent: Two of the seven justices who originally joined the majority subsequently repudiated it in whole or in part, and virtually every abortion decision since has been closely divided.”
The court is expected to hear the June Medical case this spring, and a ruling is likely in June. At issue is a 2014 Louisiana law, passed but never enacted, that requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Only one doctor in Louisiana has been able to meet the requirement, challengers of the law say, and they argue that its sole purpose is to make access to abortion more difficult. Proponents contend the law is needed to ensure the health and the safety of women seeking abortions.
The case is certain to inject the divisive politics of abortion into the 2020 presidential race. President Trump ran and won in 2016 partly on a promise to nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe, and June Medical is the court’s first case on abortion since Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, both appointed by Mr. Trump, joined the court.
The sheer number of those signing the brief suggests the importance that Republicans place on restricting abortion rights and telegraphing to their core supporters that they are serious about doing so. The signers include the top three House Republicans — Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Liz Cheney of Wyoming — and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota.
But Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, did not sign. Nor did several Republicans facing challenging re-election contests in politically competitive states, including Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona. The two Democrats who signed, Representatives Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, are both from the party’s conservative wing. Mr. Peterson broke with Democrats last month in voting against impeaching Mr. Trump, and Mr. Lipinski’s stance against abortion rights has prompted internal strife within the party.
The brief was drafted by Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion-rights group. Katie Glenn, a lawyer for the organization, said that when the court took the case, members of Congress wanted to weigh in. But, she said, they are aware that overturning Roe would be a huge leap, even for a court that is moving to the right.
“No one is going into this case with an expectation that Roe v. Wade will be overturned,” Ms. Glenn said. “However, the court has the opportunity to reconsider the precedent that has gotten us to where we’re at, and that’s all that the members of Congress were seeking to point out, that it is the court’s prerogative to assess the jurisprudence that got us here.”
Democratic lawmakers have filed their own amicus brief calling for the Louisiana law to be struck down. Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily’s List, a group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, assailed the Republican brief in a statement.
“Reproductive rights and the ability to make our own health care decisions are fundamental to the freedoms we have under the Constitution,” she said. “Unfortunately, this amicus brief proves that not only is the threat to those rights very real, but it is at a critical tipping point where the minority is ready to strip our freedom away against the majority’s wishes.”
The Republicans’ brief argues that Roe, and a series of abortion rights decisions that flowed from it, are unworkable opinions. “In sum, Roe’s jurisprudence has been characterized by Delphic confusion and protean change,” the lawmakers wrote.
They also took aim at the 1992 Casey ruling, in which the justices upheld the constitutional right to an abortion established in Roe, but found that states could impose restrictions as long as they did not constitute an “undue burden” on abortion rights.
In a 2016 case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the court, citing Casey’s “undue burden” criteria, struck down a Texas law similar to the one in Louisiana. The next year, a federal judge in Louisiana, citing Hellerstedt, struck down the Louisiana law, but that ruling has been reversed on appeal.
Now the matter rests with the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in March. In their amicus brief, the lawmakers asserted that Casey’s “undue burden” standard was “vague and opaque,” and left judges, including those in Louisiana, struggling to figure out how to apply it.
“Amici respectfully suggest that the court’s struggle — similar to dozens of other courts’ herculean struggles in this area — illustrates the unworkability of the ‘right to abortion’ found in Roe,” they wrote, “and the need for the court to take up the issue of whether Roe and Casey should be reconsidered and, if appropriate, overruled.”"
liberal,"Joe Biden Says He Raised $22.7 Million in the Fourth Quarter
Mr. Biden’s total, while far short of the haul that Senator Bernie Sanders announced earlier Thursday, was an improvement from the previous quarter.
WASHINGTON — Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Thursday that he had raised $22.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a significant improvement from his lackluster fund-raising performance in the previous three months.
Mr. Biden’s total, for the period from October through December, far exceeded the $15.7 million that he had raised during the third quarter. It was his largest quarterly haul so far, surpassing the $22 million he brought in during the second quarter.
But Mr. Biden’s fourth-quarter total was much smaller than that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign announced earlier Thursday that it had raised more than $34.5 million in the quarter. Mr. Biden, the former vice president, also lagged behind Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign revealed on Wednesday that it had brought in more than $24.7 million. Another leading candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, has not yet announced her fund-raising total.
While Mr. Biden’s fund-raising rebound did not vault him to the top of the Democratic pack, it still offered a reassuring sign for his supporters as the primary race heads into the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses in early February. His campaign said its online fund-raising doubled in the fourth quarter, and that more than half its donors in the quarter gave to the campaign for the first time. The average donation in the quarter was $41, the campaign said.
President Trump’s impeachment appeared to lift Mr. Biden’s fund-raising. The Biden campaign said the average amount of money it raised online per day more than doubled during the House’s impeachment inquiry compared with previous weeks.
Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said on Thursday that the fund-raising announcement was “just the latest evidence of Joe Biden’s growing strength and momentum.”
“These numbers clearly demonstrate Donald Trump’s lies and attacks on the vice president have only cemented and expanded his support, serving as a constant reminder to Democratic primary voters that Trump is terrified by the idea of facing Joe Biden in a general election,” Mr. Schultz said in a statement.
Mr. Biden continues to lead national primary polls, but he has faced lingering doubts about enthusiasm for his candidacy, especially from grass-roots donors. Those doubts had been exacerbated by his weak performance in the third quarter, when his campaign spent $2 million more than it took in. He ended that period with far less cash on hand than Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren or Mr. Buttigieg.
Mr. Biden’s campaign did not say how much money it had on hand at the end of the fourth quarter. But in a memo on Thursday, Mr. Schultz wrote that “we will always be playing from behind in the cash race” because Mr. Biden had not transferred money to his presidential campaign from other campaign accounts — an apparent reference to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who both did so. Mr. Schultz wrote that the campaign remained “as vigilant as ever about the budget, watching every penny.”
For the fourth quarter, Mr. Biden’s campaign had publicly set a goal of receiving 500,000 individual donations. The campaign said on Thursday that it had met that goal, though it did not specify how many donations it had received.
Mr. Biden’s grass-roots strength still lags far behind some of his rivals, such as Mr. Sanders, whose campaign said it received more than 1.8 million donations in the quarter. Mr. Sanders received far more donations in December alone — more than 900,000 — than Mr. Biden had set as a goal for the three-month period.
Unlike Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden is relying on the traditional fund-raising circuit to raise money for his campaign, in addition to what he collects from grass-roots donors. Last week, Mr. Biden released a list of more than 200 people, known as bundlers, who had raised at least $25,000 for his campaign.
Ms. Warren, asked on Thursday about her own fourth-quarter donations, said that her fund-raising total would be released “soon” and, without naming them, made an implicit jab at Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg for relying in part on big-dollar events and bundlers to bring in money from wealthy donors.
“I didn’t spend one single minute selling access to my time to millionaires and billionaires,” she said to reporters after a campaign event in Concord, N.H. “I did this grass-roots all across the country.”
The Biden campaign had already boasted of its fund-raising rebound, announcing in early December that it had raised as much money in the first two months of the fourth quarter as it had during the entire previous quarter.
And in October, Mr. Biden’s campaign effectively dropped its opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs, and a pro-Biden group, Unite the Country, is running television ads in Iowa supporting him."
liberal,"Bernie Sanders Raised $34.5 Million in the Fourth Quarter, Pacing the Field
Mr. Sanders’s total is the largest three-month haul disclosed by any candidate so far in the Democratic primary race.
DES MOINES — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, his presidential campaign said Thursday, yet another display of his enduring financial might fueled by a huge base of grass-roots donors.
Mr. Sanders received more than 1.8 million donations in the quarter, with an average donation of $18.53.
His fourth-quarter total is larger than any candidate has raised in a single quarter so far in the primary race. And it soundly eclipsed the totals of several other candidates who have reported figures for the three-month period from Oct. 1 until Dec. 31, including Pete Buttigieg, who said on Wednesday that he had raised more than $24.7 million; Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said on Thursday that he had collected $22.7 million; and Andrew Yang, who said on Thursday that he had raised more than $16.5 million.
Taken together, the high totals suggest the willingness of Democrats eager to defeat President Trump to open their checkbooks and donate to potential nominees.
But Mr. Trump still retains a formidable fund-raising advantage: On Thursday, his re-election campaign said it had raised $46 million in the final quarter of 2019. That total does not include funds raised by the Republican National Committee.
The Trump campaign said it had raised $143 million in 2019 and had a staggering $102.7 million in cash on hand.
Mr. Sanders revealed his fund-raising haul a day after announcing that he had received more than five million donations since entering the race, which he said was more “than any campaign has received at this point in a presidential election in the history of our country.”
Mr. Sanders has raised more than $96 million since he announced he was running for president last February, his campaign said.
His fund-raising success underscores why Mr. Sanders remains such a formidable candidate in the race: Despite having a heart attack that threatened to derail his bid in early October, he retains loyal supporters who are faithful to him — and undaunted by his setbacks — in a way that no other candidates’ supporters are.
His campaign has already earmarked tens of millions of dollars for television advertising in the first four nominating states and California — a tangible benefit of being so flush with cash. He can also begin to advertise and build organizational strength in other Super Tuesday states, an advantage few of his rivals can match.
And the huge influx of money gives him the resources to persist well into the primary season, unless he completely flops with voters in early states.
Another leading candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, has not yet disclosed her fund-raising total.
In a statement, Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said Mr. Sanders “is proving each and every day that working class Americans are ready and willing to fully fund a campaign that stands up for them and takes on the biggest corporations and the wealthy.”
He added: “You build a grass-roots movement to beat Donald Trump and create a political revolution one $18 donation at a time, and that’s exactly why Bernie is going to win.”
Mr. Sanders’s campaign said he had raised more than $18 million, from more than 900,000 donations, just in the month of December. It also said it had received contributions from more than 40,000 new donors on the last day of the year.
The total for the fourth quarter easily surpassed what he raised in the third quarter, $25.3 million. That total — which he announced hours before he began to experience chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas — was the largest in the Democratic field, narrowly exceeding the total raised by Ms. Warren, who is also relying on small donations.
While Ms. Warren’s campaign has acknowledged that its fund-raising slipped in the fourth quarter, Mr. Sanders’s accelerated.
His total for the fourth quarter showed the continuing strength of his grass-roots fund-raising base, a significant advantage for him, especially if the primary race turns out to be a lengthy one. Supporters who give him small amounts can continue to donate over and over, unlike big donors, many of whom give the maximum contribution of $2,800 for the primary race.
His campaign said more than 99.9 percent of its donors had not maxed out."
liberal,"He’s Not ‘Mayor Pete’ Anymore: Buttigieg’s Successor Is Sworn In
Pete Buttigieg rose to prominence, and viability as a presidential candidate, as the mayor of South Bend, Ind. Now that tenure has ended.
“Mayor Pete” is, technically, no longer Mayor Pete.
Pete Buttigieg’s eight years in office in South Bend, Ind., ended on New Year’s Day, when a new mayor was sworn in. Mr. Buttigieg, known colloquially as Mayor Pete almost since the start of his campaign last January, joined the ranks of former office holders seeking the presidency, who sometimes seem to hope that voters don’t quite notice they have slipped from power.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to cite one example, is not a former anything to his staff. In a heads-up to reporters last week, the Biden campaign advised that “Vice President Biden will attend a community event in Derry, New Hampshire.”
Stylebooks may advise newsrooms to use “former” before titles of politicians out of office, but said former office holders can be touchy about giving up the aura of power and prestige — and it has become common political courtesy, regardless, to refer to them by the titles they once held.
In an “exit interview” on Tuesday with a South Bend TV station, WNDU, Mr. Buttigieg professed to be “reluctant to hand over the keys” to his office, “just because I love the job so much.” His mayoral chief of staff, Laura O’Sullivan, posted a picture of him at his desk in the County-City Building at 10:42 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, captioned “final quiet moments.’’
ON POLITICS
Mr. Buttigieg, who turns 38 on Jan. 19, has the rare distinction of being a presidential candidate whose day job ended in the heat of his national candidacy. He leaves the stewardship of the city, where he grew up, as a household name — though a name even locals sometimes stumble over. Is it “Buddha-judge,” as most in South Bend seem to say, or, as the presidential campaign mnemonic has it, “Boot Edge Edge”?
One thing for sure: The candidate will no longer be able to say, “Mayor Pete is fine.”
Elected mayor when he was 29, Mr. Buttigieg announced in December 2018 that he would not seek a third term. He jumped into the presidential race one month later. Year-end fund-raising figures his campaign announced on Wednesday reported a door-busting $24.7 million haul in the final quarter, and more than $76 million for the year.
 “We started out as an exploratory committee with four people in a little office,” Mr. Buttigieg reminisced about his presidential start in the exit interview on Tuesday. “We had no money, not much of a mailing list even.’’
Mr. Buttigieg may have left office, but his mayoral tenure will hardly recede. As he heads into Iowa and New Hampshire voting next month as a leading candidate, his record is drawing strafing fire from opponents who question his experience and results.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in November that a woman who was mayor of a city as small as South Bend would not have been taken seriously enough to make the debate stage. A Black Lives Matter group in South Bend has called a news conference for Saturday to highlight what it calls Mr. Buttigieg’s “tolerance for racism by police,” intending to keep alive an issue that has apparently dampened Mr. Buttigieg’s appeal to black voters nationally.
Mr. Buttigieg’s last official act was to attend the swearing-in of his successor, James Mueller, at the Century Center convention hall on the Saint Joseph River downtown. The former mayor entered with his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, and his mother, Jennifer Anne Montgomery, a former professor at the University of Notre Dame.
Mr. Mueller, a childhood friend who returned home from Washington to work as Mr. Buttigieg’s chief of staff, was his handpicked successor. Little known before he ran, he bested a Democratic primary field featuring nine candidates, then cruised into office in November. As the new mayor was introduced, Mr. Buttigieg’s husband placed a hand on the former mayor’s shoulder, who shot Mr. Mueller a broad smile.
“When I was growing up, success was synonymous with getting out,” Mr. Mueller said. “On behalf of our city, I thank my predecessor, Mayor Pete, for leading us through our comeback decade.”
Mr. Buttigieg did not speak formally. He planned to return to campaigning on Thursday with seven stops in New Hampshire through the week. In the exit interview he said his house on the river in South Bend was not for sale."
liberal,"Elizabeth Warren Isn’t Talking Much About ‘Medicare for All’ Anymore
There are signs her campaign is seeking to calm fears about her health care proposal, including having small meetings with rural Iowa voters to explain her financing and transition plans.
DES MOINES — In warm-up remarks introducing Senator Elizabeth Warren at campaign rallies, young volunteers often say they are supporting her because of her plan to transform the health care system through a single-payer “Medicare for all” program. It happened in Des Moines on Saturday and Oklahoma City last week, and in western Iowa cities like Clarinda and Council Bluffs on Sunday.
But Ms. Warren herself is barely speaking of the proposal. After months of attacks from other candidates, and questions and some blowback from both liberals and moderates, the most ambitious and expensive of Ms. Warren’s many plans — and the one most likely to transform the lives of voters — is just a passing mention in her standard stump speech, rarely explored in depth unless a questioner brings it up.
“I expected her to talk more about the health care for all stuff, definitely,” said Max Goldman, 53, who attended Ms. Warren’s rally in Clarinda. Referring to her campaign, he added, “I think they know it’s controversial.”
Austin Thornton, a 32-year-old Iowan who works in film production, said he noticed Ms. Warren largely outsourced Medicare for all to another speaker. Mr. Thornton said it was a notable difference between her events and those he attended for Senator Bernie Sanders, who is vying with Ms. Warren for liberal voters in Iowa and elsewhere.
 “Bernie, he’s strong on Medicare for all, and she didn’t really bring it up,” Mr. Thornton said. “She was a little more scattered on it than I expected.”
THE 2020 RACE
Days after ending his own campaign, Julián Castro endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president.
With five weeks left before the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren is tailoring her closing message in the state to focus on rooting out Washington corruption, a potentially resonant theme with a Senate impeachment trial of President Trump expected in January. In a speech in Boston on Tuesday, she reiterated her case against corruption and asked voters to “imagine” a post-Trump era; she did not delve into many policy specifics, and mentioned Medicare for all only once.
Her campaign aides insist that fighting corruption has always been the message, and Ms. Warren has long argued that, more than any individual proposal, her suite of plans is rooted in an overarching vision of changing how Washington works, including reforms in campaign finance and lobbying.
Yet this approach, which includes shorter opening remarks and more time for audience questions, has also allowed Ms. Warren to keep her own health care plan at arm’s length at a time when she has been facing significant scrutiny. It is a clear indication that, in a tight multicandidate race in Iowa, Ms. Warren has not become fully comfortable with staking her candidacy on her plan for health care, even as many Democrats cite the issue as their top priority.
Speaking to reporters in Council Bluffs on Sunday, Ms. Warren said that if Medicare for all has received little attention at her Iowa events, it’s because “I take whatever questions come my way” and the voters have had other concerns.
And she rejected the criticism, mostly lobbied by ardent progressives, that her plan waffles on an immediate push for enacting Medicare for all and ending private health insurance, as Mr. Sanders has long proposed.
In November, after Ms. Warren faced blowback for her proposal for $20.5 trillion in new spending over 10 years to enact Medicare for all, she surprised many by proposing an expansion of public health insurance as a first step — similar to the positions of rivals like Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg — and then achieving passage of Medicare for all by the end of her third year in office.
Ms. Warren’s campaign and its surrogates say that the type of insurance offered under their plan is more comprehensive than Mr. Biden’s and Mr. Buttigieg’s proposals, and that the Warren camp has provided more details on how to implement and finance a single-payer system than Mr. Sanders.
“I’m still with Bernie and we’re still there on Medicare for all,” Ms. Warren said in Council Bluffs. “I still think it’s the right place.”
But there are signs that her campaign is proactively seeking to calm fears about her health care proposal. Denise O’Brien, a rural community activist and prominent supporter of Ms. Warren’s from Atlantic, Iowa, said she and other supporters have been coordinating with the campaign to hold Medicare for all “listening sessions” in her town.
Ms. O’Brien said that she will soon hold her third event, and that community members have had several questions, particularly since Ms. Warren was pressed during the Democratic debate in October. The typical running order of the sessions, she said, is that a doctor who supports Medicare for all explains the health care insurance system and its pitfalls, while a campaign staff member lays out Ms. Warren’s position.
They also take questions, in an attempt to quell concerns.
“People don’t like to hear ‘free,’” Ms. O’Brien said. “And we kept getting questions, so that’s why we’re having more meetings.”

It is unclear how much the Medicare for all issue has hurt Ms. Warren, if at all. Her poll numbers in Iowa leveled off in November and December, following attacks on her health care position and other issues in the October Democratic debate and questions about her plan’s details in the first half of November. But polling has been sparse in Iowa in recent weeks, and Ms. Warren has one of the largest teams of political organizers in Iowa.
In national polls released in the past two months, Ms. Warren has fallen behind Mr. Sanders, a fellow liberal on many issues but also a vocal champion of single-payer health insurance who has focused his candidacy on health care. In recent days, Ms. Warren’s campaign has also announced a dip in fund-raising ahead of the year’s end, and is widely expected to raise less money than Mr. Sanders.
For many Warren admirers who attended her Iowa rallies last weekend, no polls are needed for confirmation: They believe health care has been her Achilles’ heel. Several said in interviews that they noticed Medicare for all was sparsely mentioned by Ms. Warren, but they spun it into a positive; arguing that her anti-corruption message appealed to a wider audience.
Even Mr. Thornton, who said Ms. Warren was “scattered” on health care, said he still plans to vote for her over Mr. Sanders, whom he backed in 2016.
“She elaborates and widens the scope,” he said. “I get that corruption is at the top and it bleeds into those other issues. It touches every issue.”
Mindi Callison, a 30-year-old who saw Ms. Warren in Des Moines, said by taking more questions, Ms. Warren talks about issues many other candidates ignore, like primary education or child care.
“We know what she’s about” on health care, Ms. Callison said. “You see her commercials on that, you see her emails — we know.”
The arguments over health care were supercharged by more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, who once called Ms. Warren “extremely evasive” on the issue. For these candidates and their supporters, whom Ms. Warren was attracting this summer, health care was partly about the policy specifics but also a stand-in for larger concerns — for example, Democrats feeling risk-averse ahead of a general election against Mr. Trump.
But while moderates say liberal policies make it harder to beat Mr. Trump, Ms. Warren’s supporters argue her clear convictions and authenticity will mobilize voters.
Stephen Hueholt, 29, said he came into Ms. Warren’s Des Moines rally undecided, but left excited to caucus for her in early February.
“When she talked about fighting for what she believes in, the authenticity, that’s what’s important,” Mr. Hueholt said. “It’s not as much Medicare for all, though I know that’s an important issue — it’s that we know that she stands and fights.”
Ms. Warren has staked so much of her candidacy and political brand on policy details that some of her supporters argue that, on health care, she has been judged on a higher standard. She has provided more specifics about her health care vision than many of the Democratic rivals who criticize her — but it is also those details, particularly on Medicare for all, that have ignited controversy.
Still, because of that emphasis, a health care-size hole can sometimes seem missing from her speeches, as when she listed the top priorities of her prospective administration in her closing remarks in Des Moines.
“After we win in 2020, nobody gets to go home,” Ms. Warren told the crowd. “We all come back to push. Push on the anti-corruption bills. Push to get rid of the filibuster. Push to make changes in our immigration system. Push for a 2 cent wealth tax. To push for a Green New Deal. You push and I pull and we will make real change.”
No mention of Medicare for all."
liberal,"The Most Important Week of the Democratic Primary in 2019
How a series of turning points in mid-October explains the state of the race today and can serve as a cheat sheet for the casual 2020 primary observer.
Month after month, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. led national polls in the Democratic presidential primary race. But in early October, someone else seemed to crack the code. Lifted by her bevy of policy plans and grass-roots momentum, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joined Mr. Biden in a statistical tie atop the party’s large field of candidates.
It didn’t last.
What happened over the following days would reset the trajectory of the primary race: Mr. Biden stabilized; Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont began experiencing a reversal of fortunes; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., drew a bead on Ms. Warren; and Senator Kamala Harris of California looked less and less like a formidable candidate.
That week in mid-October — the run-up to the Oct. 15 Democratic debate and afterward — encapsulated the fluid and uncertain nature of the biggest presidential field ever. And it can function as a cheat sheet for voters trying to understand the state of the race heading into 2020.
“Candidates being under attack, facing scrutiny or going on offense themselves — that week had all that going on and is a good explanation for how we’ve gotten to this point in the primary today,” said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, the progressive group supporting left-wing candidates in Congress and in the primary.
Among the turning points was the debate itself: The surging Ms. Warren experienced significant pressure to clarify her position on “Medicare for all,” which culminated in her releasing financing and transition plans on health care that have since ignited some blowback. She has not recovered from her polling peak since.
Mr. Sanders, who had suffered a heart attack at the beginning of the month, bounced back with a lauded debate performance, and his campaign announced endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on the night of the Oct. 15 debate. Ever since, the party’s left wing has continued to rally around Mr. Sanders’s candidacy.
“Because there was so much chatter about how the Sanders campaign was over, they got to surprise everyone. And that doesn’t happen all the time in politics,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant in New York City. “And he’s been rolling since then.”
Mr. Buttigieg, in turn, helped change the tone of a markedly cordial Democratic race. He first accused Ms. Warren of “evasiveness” on health care in September, but during a Wall Street Journal interview published Oct. 13, he ratcheted up the attack, addressing Ms. Warren directly.
 “I think you should be straightforward about what your plan is going to do,” Mr. Buttigieg said, “and we haven’t seen that.”
It was during this time that he crystallized a hard pivot to the party’s ideological center, which ultimately helped him become a top-tier candidate in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
It also enraged liberals, who continue to call Mr. Buttigieg inauthentic.
“The biggest long-term impact of that past chapter of the campaign is that Pete permanently destroyed his brand,” said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “He went from being the authentic, unobjectionable, clean-cut guy to being seen as mean, dishonest, and in the pocket of Big Insurance and other big-money interests that attend his fund-raisers.” 
Mr. Biden escaped the October debate without sustained attacks from his opponents. It reflects a notable trend that has continued through the end of the year: Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have focused their attacks on each other, even as Mr. Biden continues to be the front-runner.
 “There is a reticence to attack him because it feels like there’s something you’ll have to pay for in the general,” said Akunna Cook, the former executive director of the Black Economic Alliance. “I think people have started to presume that he’s the nominee, people are starting to think it’s inevitable.”
“The progressives are so focused on Bernie versus Elizabeth that they’re not focused on Biden,” she added.
Mr. Shahid said that the former vice president has stayed away “from the level of scrutiny he received during the first months of his campaign.”
Mr. Biden’s permanence is real — his lead atop national polling averages has gone virtually unthreatened since Ms. Warren receded from her peak. It has defied the expectations of some party leaders who began the year boasting about the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which included several female candidates and black and Latino candidates. But in the December debate, six of the seven candidates onstage were white, and only one woman — Ms. Warren — remains in the top tier.
The campaign will now enter the new year almost exactly where it began — with Mr. Biden as the presumed front-runner and Mr. Sanders as his closest rival.
In the days before the October debate, candidates also revealed their third-quarter fund-raising totals — the first clear signs that the race was trending toward an all-white top tier. It highlighted the failure of the race’s two leading black candidates at the time — Ms. Harris and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey — to gain significant traction, hurt by their low poll numbers among black voters.
In the run-up to the debate, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg announced raising more than $19 million in the third quarter of fund-raising. Ms. Harris cracked double digits, but most other nonwhite candidates were far behind.

On Oct. 12, Ms. Harris held a block party in Des Moines, part of her campaign’s push to hold an event in Iowa every week in October. Her late focus on Iowa was one of a series of ill-fated strategic moves, which culminated in her surprise exit from the race in December.
At the debate days later, Ms. Harris tried to goad Ms. Warren into an argument about whether to delete President Trump’s Twitter account, which the Massachusetts senator laughed off. It was a sign of Ms. Harris’s diminished standing that Ms. Warren and her campaign team did not feel the need to respond.
Kamala Harris going after Elizabeth Warren on banning Trump from twitter is one of the more pathetic stunts I've seen in a debate.
Also in early October, the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats began taking closed-door depositions. Their timeline set in motion dynamics that now threaten to upend the nomination process.
Mr. Trump, for one, has already promised to make next year’s re-election in part a referendum on House Democrats. And a Senate impeachment trial during the Democratic primaries and caucuses could complicate the campaign schedules for the crop of senators still in the race — Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Booker and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado.
“I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution,” Mr. Booker has said. “I didn’t swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution unless there’s an election coming up.”

Impeachment also influenced the Biden campaign. In late September and early October, Mr. Biden struggled to respond to Mr. Trump’s attacks against his son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in Ukraine, even though there was no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claims. By mid-October, Mr. Biden had begun hitting back more effectively on Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. And on Oct. 15, ABC News broadcast an interview with Hunter Biden in which he admitted fault but also defended himself.
 “I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That’s where I made the mistake,” the younger Mr. Biden said. “So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”
Every race is fluid, of course, and the dynamics set in motion in mid-October could shift, particularly considering that the Iowa caucuses famously break late. In the Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles, for example, Ms. Warren departed from her traditional refusal to criticize other candidates — as did Ms. Klobuchar, who directly chided Mr. Buttigieg.
One big unknown is fund-raising. On Oct. 16, Mr. Biden disclosed a cash-on-hand number so low — $9 million — that it startled many in the party’s moderate wing and some supporters. His apparent vulnerability as a front-runner helped spur two new entrants in the race, former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and one of the richest people in the country.
“When Biden showed, not that just that fund-raising was lackluster, but that they were spending more money than they were raising, it showed not just that the candidate was in trouble,” Ms. Katz said. “You had a campaign team that was committing malpractice.”
One of the big questions of the Democratic race now is whether Mr. Bloomberg’s self-funded candidacy can break through to moderate voters, or whether they will coalesce around Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg or another contender. Mr. Biden’s fund-raising and poll numbers largely stabilized through the fall, and he begins 2020 in arguably his strongest shape since things started turning around in that week in October."
liberal,"Trump Says U.S. and China Will Sign Trade Deal in January
President Trump said that the ceremony would be held at the White House and that he would go to Beijing to continue discussions about a Phase 2 deal.
WASHINGTON — President Trump said Tuesday that the United States and China would sign a “very large and comprehensive” trade deal at the White House on Jan. 15, though exact details of the agreement were not released.
The signing would cement the first phase of an agreement that took nearly two years to negotiate and would formalize a trade truce between the world’s two largest economies. The president, who announced the date of the ceremony on Twitter, said that “high level representatives of China” would attend the signing ceremony and that he planned to travel to China “at a later date” to begin talks on the second phase of the agreement.
I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15. The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present. At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!

Mr. Trump did not say whether Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, would be in attendance or name any representatives from China who might attend the ceremony.
Text of the agreement, reached in mid-December, has not been made public, and its exact contents have yet to be fully vetted by experts or the many businesses that have suffered from the protracted trade fight with China. The deal would reduce only a small portion of the tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, leaving many levies in place.
Officials from both countries have said the agreement includes commitments from China to increase purchases of American farm and energy products, places limits on Beijing’s ability to weaken its currency and provides enhanced protections to American companies doing business in China. The agreement also would reduce tariffs on about $120 billion worth of goods, and forestalled new tariffs that were scheduled for Dec. 15.
In announcing the agreement, the United States said that China’s farm purchases were expected to grow to at least $40 billion annually over a period of two years and that total exports of food, energy, manufactured goods and services to China would increase by a total of $200 billion. Chinese officials, however, have remained vague when describing what they agreed to buy and on what timeline.

Details on China’s purchase commitments could be left out of the text of the agreement that is made public because officials have been concerned that commodities markets could be distorted if such information is released. The deal is expected to have some flexibility so that China can tailor its purchases to market demand.
Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, told CNBC on Tuesday that the American negotiating team was working out the final details before the signing, which had been expected during the first week of January.
 “We’re just waiting for the Chinese translation of the 86-page agreement,” he said.
The trade dispute between the United States and China rattled the world economy during the last 19 months as both countries raised tariffs and other trade barriers while negotiations sputtered and stalled. By breaking the agreement into pieces, China was able to avoid additional tariffs and Mr. Trump secured a policy win heading into his re-election campaign.
Yet the first phase of the agreement does not address many of the most significant concerns that the United States has with China’s economic practices, particularly its industrial policy and subsidies of state-owned enterprises. Mr. Trump has said those issues will be addressed in future talks and has said the remaining tariffs will continue to exert pressure on China to accede to America’s demands.
Mr. Trump announced the signing just before markets opened on Tuesday. The S&P 500 index in the United States was up slightly by the end of the day’s trading.
Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration, said translating the text of the agreement had been complicated because the United States wanted to ensure that the commitments were legally binding rather than just statements of what China’s intended.
“We’re entering a period now, before the signing, to see if it really gets locked in or they renege again,” Mr. Pillsbury said, suggesting that Mr. Trump publicized the date of the ceremony on Twitter to put additional pressure on China.
Mr. Pillsbury suggested, however, that Mr. Trump believed his relationship with Mr. Xi would be a political asset in 2020 as he made the case to voters that he had rebalanced America’s relationship with China."
liberal,"‘Nothing Less Than a Civil War’: These White Voters on the Far Right See Doom Without Trump
Deeply conservative, they organize online and outside the Republican Party apparatus, engaging in more explicit versions of the chest-beating seen at the president’s rallies.
By Astead W. Herndon
Dec. 28, 2019
GOLDEN VALLEY, Ariz. — Great American Pizza & Subs, on a highway about 100 miles southeast of Las Vegas, was busier and Trumpier than usual. On any given day it serves “M.A.G.A. Subs” and “Liberty Bell Lasagna.” The “Second Amendment” pizza comes “loaded” with pepperoni and sausage. The dining room is covered in regalia praising President Trump.
But this October morning was “Trumpstock,” a small festival celebrating the president. The speakers included the local Republican congressman, Paul Gosar, and lesser-known conservative personalities. There was a fringe 2020 Senate candidate in Arizona who ran a website that published sexually explicit photos of women without their consent; a pro-Trump rapper whose lyrics include a racist slur aimed at Barack Obama; and a North Carolina activist who once said of Muslims, “I will kill every one of them before they get to me.”
All were welcome, except liberals.
“They label us white nationalists, or white supremacists,” volunteered Guy Taiho Decker, who drove from California to attend the event. A right-wing protester, he has previously been arrested on charges of making terrorist threats.
“There’s no such thing as a white supremacist, just like there’s no such thing as a unicorn,” Mr. Decker said. “We’re patriots.”
As Mr. Trump’s bid for re-election shifts into higher gear, his campaign hopes to recapture voters who drifted away from the party in 2018 and 2019: independents who embraced moderate Democratic candidates, suburban women tired of Mr. Trump’s personal conduct and working-class voters who haven’t benefited from his economic policies.
But if any group remains singularly loyal to Mr. Trump, it is the small but impassioned number of white voters on the far right, often in rural communities like Golden Valley, who extol him as a cultural champion reclaiming the country from undeserving outsiders.
These voters don’t passively tolerate Mr. Trump’s “build a wall” message or his ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries — they’re what motivates them. They see themselves in his fear-based identity politics, bolstered by conspiratorial rhetoric about caravans of immigrants and Democratic “coups.”
The president draws support from a broader political and ideological cross-section of Republicans than the Trumpstock crowd reflected, and he attracts some independents and Democrats as well. The festival itself was relatively small, drawing about 100 people, though significant enough to attract the likes of Mr. Gosar.
But events like it, as well as speaking engagements featuring far-right supporters of the president, have become part of the political landscape during the Trump era. Islamophobic taunts can be heard at his rallies. Hate speech and conspiracy theories are staples of some far-right websites. If Trumpstock was modest in size, it stood out as a sign of extremist public support for a sitting president.
And these supporters have electoral muscle in key areas: Mr. Trump outperformed Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, in rural parts of Arizona like Mohave County, where Golden Valley is located. Mr. Trump won 58,282 votes in the county, compared to 47,901 for Mr. Romney, though Mr. Romney carried the state by a much bigger vote margin.
Arizona will be a key battleground state in 2020: Democrats already flipped a Senate seat and a Tucson-based congressional district from red to blue in 2018. For Mr. Trump, big turnout from white voters in areas like Mohave County — and in rural parts of other battlegrounds like Florida, Michigan, Minnesota and Georgia — could be a lifeline in a tight election.
“We like to call this the ‘Red Wall of Arizona,’” said Laurence Schiff, a psychiatrist and Republican campaign official in Mohave County who organizes in support of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “Winning the state starts here, with us.”
Grass-roots gatherings play a critical role in the modern culture of political organizing, firing up ardent supporters and cementing new ones. Small circles of Trump-supporting conservatives, often organized online and outside the traditional Republican Party apparatus, engage in more decentralized — and explicit — versions of the chest-beating that happens at Mr. Trump’s closely watched political rallies. 
In interviews, people in the crowd described a white America under threat as racial minorities typified by Mr. Obama, the country’s first black president, gain political power. They described Mr. Trump as an inspirational figure who is undoing Mr. Obama’s legacy and beating back the perceived threat of Muslim and Latino immigrants, whom they denounced in prejudiced terms.
 “I don’t have a problem with Muslims,” said Angus Smith, an Arizona resident who attended the festival, “but can they take the rag off their head out of respect for our country?”
At Mr. Trump’s official rallies, including a recent one in Florida, the president has referred to Mr. Obama by stressing his middle name, Hussein, and said Democrats were “trying to stop me because I’m fighting for you.”
The Trumpstock speakers pushed even further, tying Mr. Obama’s middle name to a false belief that he is a foreign-born Muslim.
And Democrats were portrayed as not just political opponents, but avatars of doom for Mr. Trump’s predominantly white voter base and for the country.
“There is no difference between the democratic socialists and the National Socialists,” said Evan Sayet, a conservative writer who spoke at the event, referencing Nazi Germany. Democrats, he said, “are the heirs to Adolf Hitler.”
A Republican Party shaped in Trump’s image
Speakers at Trumpstock said their cultural fears had been exacerbated by their state’s own changing nature: Arizona is on the front lines of undocumented border crossings from Mexico and racial minorities are expected to outnumber white people in the state in the next decade.
Arizona Democrats made political gains in 2018, and the national party is riding high after it won governor’s races this year in Kentucky and Louisiana. But Republicans remain bullish. They argue that a slice of their electoral base will only vote when the president is on the ballot, and point to regions like Northern Arizona as places to find, as Mr. Trump wrote in a recent tweet, “the Angry Majority.”
“We have the greatest base in the history of politics,” he said at a recent rally in Florida.
In Arizona, the most prominent pro-Trump, anti-immigrant groups are AZ Patriots and Patriot Movement AZ, which have held tight to the themes of white nationalism that some Republicans have denounced. In September, after repeated clashes, some members of the groups agreed to a court order to stop harassing migrants and church volunteers who help them.
Earlier this year, the groups and their allies organized a “Patriotism over Socialism” event in Gilbert, Ariz., near Phoenix, that included speeches from Representative Andy Biggs, the area’s congressman, and Kelli Ward, the state’s Republican Party chair. They appeared alongside more fringe figures: Sharon Slater of Family Watch International, which has promoted figures associated with anti-L.G.B.T. conversion therapy, and Laura Loomer, the far-right activist and Arizona native who was banned by Twitter and some other platforms after making anti-Muslim comments.
This blend of insider and outsider, of mainstream and conspiracy, is a feature of how Mr. Trump has reshaped the Republican Party in his image, and the core of his presidential origin story. Before Mr. Trump announced any firm plans to seek office, he was the national face of the “birther” conspiracy, which thrived in the Tea Party movement and had a significant amount of support from the Republican base, polls showed.
Stacey Goodman, a former police officer from New York who retired to Arizona and attended Trumpstock, said her distrust of Mr. Obama’s birth certificate had led her to Mr. Trump.
 “If you’re Muslim, just tell us you’re Muslim,” she said of Mr. Obama. “It’s not that I didn’t believe him, I’m just not qualified to answer that question. I’ve seen information on both sides that’s compelling.”
Mona Fishman, a singer from the Las Vegas area who performed at the event, has written Trump-themed songs with titles like “Fake News” and “Smells like Soros,” which accuses liberal megadonor George Soros of running a shadow government, a trope widely condemned as anti-Semitic.
In the White House, Mr. Trump has relied on similar unfounded conspiracy theories and promoted people who have perpetuated them. He pardoned Joseph M. Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, a hero of Arizona’s right wing and a leader of the “birther” movement, who was convicted of criminal contempt related to his aggressive efforts to detain undocumented immigrants.
On Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, likely the most watched in the world, he has promoted white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots, and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that top Democrats are worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.
Even mainstream conservative media figures have embraced QAnon as a way to dismiss Mr. Trump’s political enemies. The Fox News host Jesse Watters, during a recent segment dedicated to the conspiracy, linked it to Mr. Trump’s Washington enemies. “Isn’t it also about the Trump fight with the deep state in terms of the illegal surveillance of the campaign, the inside hit jobs that he’s sustained?” he asked.
The embrace of conspiracy theories has frustrated some establishment Republicans and moderate Republican voters, who urge Mr. Trump to embrace a more traditional communication style.
His base disagrees.
“Please never stop tweeting,” Ms. Fishman sings in one of her songs, titled “Thank You President Trump.” “I can hardly wait to see what I’ll be reading.”
 ‘I don’t believe in violence, but...’
Events like Trumpstock are not limited to Arizona. Its organizer, Laurie Bezick, recruited speakers from around the country through social media, tapping into a network of pro-Trump voices only a click away.
Long-shot congressional candidates touting an “America First” agenda came from places like Iowa and Maryland. Leaders of fledgling political groups with names like JEXIT: Jews Exit The Democratic Party, Latinos for Trump and Deplorable Pride, a right-wing L.G.B.T. organization, told the overwhelmingly white audience they were not anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, homophobic or racist. In fact, the speakers insisted, people who used those terms were more guilty of bigotry than the people they accused.
To applause, the co-founder of Latinos for Trump, Marco Gutierrez, read the pledge he took when he became a naturalized citizen and renounced his Mexican homeland. Nitemare, a pro-Trump rapper who refused to give his legal name, invoked QAnon and called Mr. Obama a racist slur in his set.
Brian Talbert, the founder of Deplorable Pride, was contacted by the White House after he was barred from the L.G.B.T. pride parade in Charlotte, N.C. At Trumpstock, Mr. Talbert, who has a history of expressing anti-Muslim beliefs on social media, gave voice to hatred of Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Mr. Trump’s 2016 opponent.
“I think she should be hanging at the end of a rope for treason,” he said of Mrs. Clinton.
Members of groups like these at once make up a critical portion of Arizona’s conservative base, and espouse derogatory rhetoric that must repeatedly be repudiated, creating political difficulties for the state’s Republican lawmakers. After a photograph emerged last April of members of Patriot Movement AZ posing with Gov. Doug Ducey, he said he had never heard of the group. “I absolutely denounce their behavior,” he added.
Trumpstock attendees say they are used to being denounced, another quality they feel they share with the president. It’s part of why they are protective of him, to the point that they refuse to acknowledge the possibility of a Trump loss in 2020.
Mark Villalta said he had been stockpiling firearms, in case Mr. Trump’s re-election is not successful.
“Nothing less than a civil war would happen,” Mr. Villalta said, his right hand reaching for a holstered handgun. “I don’t believe in violence, but I’ll do what I got to do.”

liberal,"Joe Biden Says He Would Comply With a Senate Subpoena, Reversing Course
Mr. Biden asserted that no “legal basis” existed for the Senate to seek his testimony in the impeachment trial, but he later told a crowd that he would comply with “any subpoena that was sent to me.”
FAIRFIELD, Iowa — Joseph R. Biden Jr. backtracked on Saturday from his stated position that he would not comply with a subpoena to testify in President Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate. Instead, he declared that he would abide by “any subpoena that was sent to me” even as he insisted there was no justification for calling him as a witness.
A day after reaffirming that he would not comply with a subpoena, Mr. Biden tried twice on Saturday to clarify his remarks, asserting that there would be no “legal basis” for such a subpoena but left it unclear, for much of the day, if he would ultimately comply with one. Then, questioned by a voter about the issue of compliance with subpoenas, Mr. Biden answered unequivocally.
“I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” he said at a town hall-style event in Fairfield.
Mr. Biden’s 180-degree turn on whether he would comply with a subpoena was one of the starkest and swiftest reversals by a candidate in the Democratic primary campaign, and came after he faced questions and criticism about whether his initial stand would run counter to the rule of law.
Mr. Biden’s varied responses to a hypothetical question, which he criticized himself for drawing attention to in the first place, played out from a series of tweets on Saturday morning to remarks to reporters early in the afternoon to his answer in Fairfield on Saturday night.
The issue loomed over his campaign as he courted Iowa voters on a two-day swing, joining several other candidates under a gray, rainy sky as they returned to the state just over five weeks before the nominating caucuses.
On Saturday morning, Mr. Biden wrote on Twitter that he wanted to “clarify” comments he had made on Friday, when he met with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register, whose endorsement in the Iowa caucuses is highly sought after by presidential candidates.
Mr. Biden was asked by The Register whether he stood by previous comments that he would not comply with a subpoena to testify in the impeachment trial. He said he did, and explained that complying with a subpoena and testifying would effectively allow Mr. Trump to shift attention onto Mr. Biden and away from the president’s own conduct. Mr. Biden made similar comments to reporters aboard his campaign bus on Friday night.
On Saturday morning, Mr. Biden elaborated on Twitter: “I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine.”
He also wrote that over the course of his decades-long political career, he had “always complied with a lawful order,” and that in his two terms as vice president, his office had “cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.”
Speaking to reporters after a town hall-style event in Tipton, Mr. Biden said he had “no firsthand knowledge” about the accusations against Mr. Trump, so there was “no basis” for calling him as a witness. But, he added, “I would honor whatever the Congress in fact legitimately asked me to do.”
Asked if he would challenge a subpoena in court, he responded: “The answer is, I don’t think that’s going to happen to begin with. Let’s cross that bridge when it comes.” He added that he would abide by “whatever was legally required of me.”
One of Mr. Biden’s top rivals for the Democratic nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also weighed in on Saturday, telling reporters in Des Moines, “If there is a lawfully issued order for a subpoena, then he should follow it.”
The House impeached Mr. Trump this month over his campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said she would not formally send the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber until she had assurances that the trial would be conducted fairly.
As he spoke to reporters in Tipton, Mr. Biden seemed to fault himself for creating a story line in the news media that continued on Saturday. Mr. Biden observed that “this is going to be the news today” and added that he was “criticizing myself,” not the news media.
“I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” he said. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round. We’re not talking about: What did Trump do?” 
Traveling around Iowa in his “No Malarkey” campaign bus, Mr. Biden held three town hall-style events on Saturday, fielding questions from the audience at each one. At an event in Washington, Iowa, one attendee asked Mr. Biden if he would nominate former President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court.
“If he’d take it, yes,” Mr. Biden responded.
The campaigning resumed even if many Iowans were more focused on college football than politics.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., spent Saturday afternoon meeting voters in the Des Moines area and fielding questions that, at times, homed in on two of his biggest vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate — doubts about whether his high-minded words about fixing the nation’s problems can produce tangible results, and his ability to attract more African-American support.
In a middle school gymnasium in Marshalltown, about an hour northeast of Des Moines, one man told Mr. Buttigieg that he needed more than just “vision statements and goals.” The mayor responded by noting there was a reason “I’m being a little careful on what I promise,” which he then followed up with a thinly veiled critique of plans by opponents like Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to offer free college tuition and “Medicare for all” health care plans.
“Don’t get me wrong,” he said. “We’re offering big, bold, ambitious ideas.” But candidates, he added, can have ideas that are both “big and practical.”
Later, at a meeting in Des Moines that included several people affiliated with the N.A.A.C.P., a young black man pointedly asked Mr. Buttigieg, “How can we trust you to be a champion on racial justice?” After the mayor walked the young man through what he said was some “misinformation” about his record with African-Americans, the questioner still was not satisfied and pressed him. Why should you be president, he asked, “if you didn’t do a good job in South Bend?”
“Most people in South Bend believe I did a good job,” Mr. Buttigieg responded, including, he added, people of color. “And I would invite you to check the data on that.”
Ms. Warren also returned to Iowa after a holiday break, with two events in the Des Moines area that focused on her core message of economic inequality and structural changes. In Urbandale, Ms. Warren pitched herself as a pragmatic progressive who could work across the aisle, citing a hearing aid bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump in 2017.
“This is about making markets work,” she said, separating herself from Mr. Sanders — who calls himself a democratic socialist and is more openly critical of capitalist markets.

liberal,"They Can’t Get Enough of ‘The West Wing’ Right Now
President Bartlet doesn’t live in the White House, even on TV, anymore. But his fans find solace in streaming an old favorite.
Election night, 2017. Alarmed and unnerved by the state of politics in America, Josh Reinitz, a lawyer and Democrat in Fair Lawn, N.J., is running for borough council. But it is a stressful time.
As his campaign waits for the results at a local senior center, Mr. Reinitz slips away to a dark room to the side and powers up his iPhone. For the next 45 minutes, he sits by himself watching television — “Two Cathedrals,” to be specific, his favorite “West Wing” episode.
“Fortunately,” Mr. Reinitz recalled recently, “I was able to immerse myself in the episode to the point that I didn’t hear another sound until the room erupted in cheers as our victory was assured.”
“The West Wing,” a workplace drama set in the White House and dedicated to the notion that Washington is run by good people who are doing their best, was broadcast on NBC for seven seasons, from 1999 to 2006. Though its ratings declined over the years, at its peak it regularly drew more than 17 million viewers.
It is now streaming on Netflix. And to its many liberal and independent-leaning fans, in particular, it has become something more than just a nostalgic drama from a time when men’s suits with pleated pants are fashionable and Twitter does not yet exist. For many in the Trump era, the show is an idealistic alternative reality, an escape from the vitriol and ill-will that they see coursing like poison through contemporary politics.
Much as people may return to the film “It’s a Wonderful Life” to remind themselves that feeling worthless does not mean you have no worth, or to the children’s book “Goodnight Moon” to remember that bedtime once meant being enveloped in a cocoon of love, fans revisit “The West Wing” to recall an era — even a fictional one — when it seemed possible for the three branches of government to be populated by public servants of integrity, intellect and wit.
“When I feel the need for comfort from the circus in the White House, I watch the pilot,” said Terry Callanan Kempf of Glens Falls, N.Y., who belongs to the Facebook group “Fans of West Wing Weekly Podcast,” whose members share a passion for revisiting the show. “Seriously, almost every night before I go to sleep.”
“The West Wing” premiered two years into President Bill Clinton’s second term in office, but the bulk of it was broadcast during President George W. Bush’s administration. The partisan divide was bad then, but it was not nearly so awful — so personal, so vicious, so apocalyptic, so apparently beyond redemption — as it appears to many people now.
Bradley Whitford, the actor who played Josh Lyman, the deputy White House chief of staff, has called the show “liberal porn,” and that is true, in a way. Its president, Josiah Bartlet, is a progressive Democrat whose policies run firmly to the left. Erudite, articulate, empathetic, able to speak Latin and quote the Bible, inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt, he seems almost painfully distant from many American presidents (some perhaps more than others).
But “The West Wing” also presents the opposition Republicans, for the most part, as equally honorable — as much as they may disagree with President Bartlet’s politics. For much of his administration, he battles a Congress led by Republicans, losing as often as he wins.
“The bulk of the mail we’d get would be from people who identified themselves as Republicans or said, ‘I don’t agree with the politics’ but nonetheless liked the way they felt when they watched the show,” Aaron Sorkin, who created the show and wrote nearly all of the episodes in the first four seasons, said in an email. “That continues today.”
Katherine Bell Butler, 43, a lifelong conservative from Sharpsburg, Ga., who describes herself as “not crazy over Trump,” said that she had the boxed set, and had watched every episode of “The West Wing” “multiple times.”
“I love the show,” she said in a Facebook message. “Even when I disagreed with something said, I honestly didn’t care.”
For Allison Picard, 61, a retired local government official from Martinez, Calif., the best episodes are those that show healthy bipartisan cooperation, as in Season 4 when President Bartlet, played by the actor Martin Sheen, steps aside after his daughter is kidnapped by terrorists, briefly ceding control of the country to the conservative Republican speaker of the house, played by the actor John Goodman. (The vice president has unfortunately resigned over a sex scandal, leaving a gap in the order of succession.)
Ms. Picard also loves the president’s decision to hire Ainsley Hayes, a fast-talking, fast-thinking Republican lawyer who vehemently disagrees with him. “It’s such a patriotic moment, that the president would want someone who was smart and who would challenge his perspective,” Ms. Picard said, sounding a little teary over the phone.
Netflix does not release viewing figures, so it is impossible to know how popular “The West Wing” reruns are. But for something that ended 13 years ago, the show continues to have a peculiar relevance to public life.
While a student at Harvard, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, ran for president of the Institute of Politics in part by proposing that students meet for “West Wing” viewing parties.
He has appeared on “The West Wing Weekly” podcast and seems to see himself as a “West Wing”-style politician. When he opened his presidential campaign office, Mr. Buttigieg posted a video of himself walking down the hall while interacting with his aides, one of the classic shots from the show. “Finally an office with room for a walk and talk,” he wrote on Twitter.

There is also a “What would Bartlet Do?” Facebook page, with nearly 4,200 members. At American University in Washington, students compare the show to real life in Gautham Rao’s “The West Wing as History” course. And on “The West Wing Weekly” podcast, the actor Joshua Malina, who played Will Bailey in the show, and Hrishikesh Hirway, a musician and superfan, have been hosting an episode-by-episode discussion of the program since March 2016.
They are currently up to the final season, which only has a few more episodes scheduled. Some 3,500 fans showed up in London for a live broadcast recently. (The podcast has its own Facebook page, with more than 56,000 followers. The fans’ Facebook group has 6,800 members.)
“It’s a particularly painful time to be watching the show,” Mr. Malina said. “We have an administration and a chief executive who ought to watch it for basic civics lessons about the Constitution and checks and balances and all the stuff the rest of us learned in fifth grade.”
Not everyone is into it, of course. People who don’t like “The West Wing” say, as they have all along, that the program presents an unrealistically idealistic view of government, that it moralizes, that it preaches, that it incorrectly suggests that minds can be swayed by grand gestures and eloquent speeches.
 “I sense there are two kinds of people: people who like ‘The West Wing’ and people who find that shows like ‘Veep’ and ‘House of Cards’ are much more realistic portrayals of how politics happen in the real world,” said Christy Quirk, an American-born consultant who lives in Nice, France, and is also a member of the podcast fans’ page on Facebook.
She would put herself in the latter group.
“I watched the first season or so, but I found the speechifying, the high-minded earnestness — it was like fingernails on a blackboard,” she said. “The stakes are really high right now, and we have to have a very realistic view of what can happen if we don’t understand the real dynamics and motivations of people, that not everyone is in this for the right reasons.”
But it can be hard, sometimes, to follow politics in Washington and not indulge in wishful thinking, even when what you are wishing for comes from a television show.
After observing the impeachment proceedings unfold, Al Sibilo of Alberta, Canada, had a question: Why can’t the politicians in 2019 behave more like the politicians on “The West Wing”?
He is thinking of a particular time in Season 3 when the hostile Congress investigates President Bartlet after he fails to disclose his multiple sclerosis while running for office. But instead of impeaching him, the Republicans censure him.
“Censure may have been a great option for the Democrats and perhaps a more proportional response to many of the president’s wrongdoings and indiscretions,” Mr. Sibilo, 53, said of President Trump.
On the other hand, he said in an email, Mr. Trump is unique in his zest for flouting the norms of presidential behavior.
 “As a concurrent resolution, they’d need President Trump to admit he was even just a little bit wrong — it will never happen,” Mr. Sibilo said.
Kim Elliott, 50, a teacher in Nashua, N.H., is a devoted viewer who spent much of Inauguration Day — Jan. 20, 2017 — watching not the inauguration, but “The West Wing.”
During her lunch hour, she sat alone in her classroom and watched the pilot episode. When she got home, she watched three more of her favorite episodes — two about the Supreme Court and the third a special episode in Season 3 featuring real-life presidents and staff members from both parties.
“I watched these episodes not to wallow, but to gear up,” Ms. Elliott said in an email. “Yes, I was avoiding the news coverage. But I wanted to remind myself of what ideas to keep front and center.”"
liberal,"Inside the Biggest 2020 Advertising War Against Trump
Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign wants to flood voters with attacks on Mr. Trump before it is too late, a lesson Republican candidates learned in 2016 when they initially ignored him.
WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton tried. So did 16 rival Republicans. And after hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on ads attacking Donald Trump in 2016, the results were the same: They never did much damage.
Now Michael R. Bloomberg is trying — his way — spending millions each week in an online advertising onslaught that is guided by polling and data that he and his advisers believe provide unique insight into the president’s vulnerabilities.
The effort, which is targeting seven battleground states where polls show Mr. Trump is likely to be competitive in November, is just one piece of an advertising campaign that is unrivaled in scope and scale. On Facebook and Google alone, where Mr. Bloomberg is most focused on attacking the president, he has spent $18 million on ads over the last month, according to Acronym, a digital messaging firm that works with Democrats.
That is on top of the $128 million the Bloomberg campaign has spent on television ads, according to Advertising Analytics, an independent firm, which projects that Mr. Bloomberg is likely to spend a combined $300 million to $400 million on advertising across all media before the Super Tuesday primaries in early March.

Those amounts dwarf the ad budgets of his rivals, and he is spending at a faster clip than past presidential campaigns as well. Mr. Bloomberg is also already spending more than the Trump campaign each week to reach voters online. And if the $400 million estimate holds, that would be about the same as what President Barack Obama’s campaign spent on advertising over the course of the entire general election in 2012.
Video
The ads amount to a huge bet by the Bloomberg campaign that there are enough Americans who are not too fixed in their opinions of Mr. Trump and can be swayed by the ads’ indictment of his conduct and character.
None of these assumptions are safe in a political environment that is increasingly bifurcated along partisan lines and where, for many voters, information from “the other side” is instantly suspect. But Mr. Bloomberg’s aides believe it is imperative to flood voters with attacks on the president before it is too late — a lesson Republicans learned in 2016 when they initially spent most of their ad budgets during the primaries tearing into each other while ignoring Mr. Trump.
“All this effort and all this money and none of it goes to help the one election that really matters?” asks a man from Michigan in one new Bloomberg campaign ad, referring to the spending in the Democratic primary. The campaign plans to run the ad online in Super Tuesday primary states.
Another man featured in the ad bemoans the fact that the Trump campaign is so focused on Pennsylvania but that none of the Democrats seem to be. “By the looks of it, he’s trying to win Pennsylvania once again. He’s here all the time,” the man says.
In swing states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that are likely to decide whether Mr. Trump gets re-elected, the president’s campaign and its allies have already been advertising on his behalf for more than a year. Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign is focusing its efforts there, hoping to erode Mr. Trump’s standing.
“I’ve been telling anyone who will listen, Trump is winning,” said Kevin Sheekey, the campaign manager for Mr. Bloomberg.
In interviews, Mr. Bloomberg’s top strategists described how they believe they can undermine Mr. Trump’s standing with voters who are open to reconsidering their support for him. According to the campaign’s data, this is somewhere between 10 percent to 15 percent of the people who voted for him in 2016.
STATE OF THE RACE
Mr. Bloomberg’s aides say their data generally shows that these people tend to express disappointment about promises Mr. Trump has failed to keep on issues like rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure — an especially potent concern in places like Michigan. In most states, they are upset with the president’s push to repeal the Affordable Care Act without putting forward a Republican alternative, which voters view as jeopardizing their health coverage. They view his response to several mass shootings during his term as lacking urgency and seriousness, particularly in the suburbs around Detroit and Philadelphia, the Bloomberg data shows.
And many of them report feelings of exasperation and exhaustion after three years of what seems like daily, head-spinning stories about Mr. Trump, his impulsivity, dysfunction inside his administration and partisan squabbling in Washington that has in some cases bled into their lives at home and work.
 “With the percentage of the electorate that is open to reconsidering, there is a tax on them that they want to eliminate — and that tax is on their attention,” said Gary Briggs, who last year left Facebook as its chief marketing officer to join Mr. Bloomberg’s company and is now advising his presidential campaign.
The messages that the Bloomberg campaign is using in ads on social media and other websites are tailored to this sense of exhaustion. “Say no to chaos,” says one that appeared on Facebook in North Carolina.
“Another tweet. Another lie. Trump has tweeted thousands of false statements — causing chaos and embarrassing our country,” reads another, depicting a picture of a man covering his face in evident despair as he stands in what appears to be a soybean field. (Soybean farmers have been among the most affected by Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.)
Others are more issue-specific and play to a notion that Bloomberg strategists say has tested well in their research: The president is looking out for the interests of big corporations and the wealthy despite promises to improve the lives of working-class Americans.
The seven states the Bloomberg campaign has chosen are some of the most competitive, like Wisconsin and Florida, and others where Democrats believe they can chip away at Republican dominance, like Texas and Arizona. Rounding out the list are Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
The Trump campaign has responded aggressively to Mr. Bloomberg’s entry into the race, going so far as to bar reporters from Bloomberg News from its rallies and events because the outlet has said it would not conduct investigative reporting on Mr. Bloomberg’s rivals for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Trump has belittled the former mayor and dismissed him as a threat saying, “Little Michael will fail.”
Finding the most incisive way to attack a sitting president is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons. Not only does the president enjoy the power and platform of incumbency, but by and large Americans have already formed their views over the course of the first term. 
Larry McCarthy, a Republican ad maker who wrote many of the super PAC ads that attempted to undercut President Barack Obama’s popularity with swing voters in 2012, said he believes his ads were not as effective “because many voters had already made a judgment about Obama.”
That judgment, he said, was that “a significant number of voters, in our data, did not like Obama policies but did not think he was a bad guy.”
With Mr. Trump, the opposite is true. Polls show that, for instance, most Americans approve of his handling of the economy. But they consistently give him low job approval ratings, saying that they do not think he is honest.
And public polls further show he stands an even chance of winning many battleground states against a variety of the Democratic candidates, which the Bloomberg campaign said tracks with its internal data.
With the ads, the Bloomberg campaign is also walking a fine line between trying to undercut Mr. Trump and turning off voters who may not like the president but do not want to dwell on him.
“There is a kind of anxiety that he creates,” said Howard Wolfson, one of Mr. Bloomberg’s longtime top advisers, about Mr. Trump. “This is real for people,” he added, acknowledging the contradictory factors. “There’s a bit of ‘Leave us alone.’”
The campaign said that it had produced 160 versions of its ads on social media alone, reaching 15.5 million people in the first two weeks of December.
“Michael Bloomberg’s fledgling campaign has now spent more on Google and YouTube in the past month than the Trump campaign has spent all year,” Acronym said in a recent analysis of the race.
The ability to pour that much money into ads not only enables Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign to pump out millions of messages a week, it also allows for more precise targeting to individual groups of uncommitted voters — whether that’s women in the suburbs concerned about gun violence or more fiscally conservative people who are alarmed at the nation’s rapidly expanding deficit.
One of the most potentially significant impacts of the Bloomberg strategy, said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco and an expert in political advertising, could be how he is filling the void in places where pro-Trump ads are dominant.
In a new study Mr. Goldstein conducted with a group of other academics who specialize in political messaging, he said they found that in 2016 the lack of advertising from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign seemed to contribute to lower turnout among voters favorable to her. Democrats with a lower propensity of voting in Michigan and Wisconsin, the study found, were less likely to turn out in areas where Mr. Trump was investing heavily online but where Mrs. Clinton was not advertising.
“The overall impact was modest, to be sure,” Mr. Goldstein said. “But Trump’s margin of victory in Michigan and Wisconsin was also extremely modest.”
In addition to the hard-hitting critiques of Mr. Trump and his leadership, Mr. Bloomberg’s ads are also designed to send a positive message about the former mayor that reaches Democrats in the primary. And it is those voters, no doubt, who need to be convinced first in order for Mr. Bloomberg to politically benefit from his huge investment in anti-Trump advertising.
 “Sometimes it’s easiest to define yourself by what you are not,” said Todd Harris, a Republican messaging strategist who has worked on several presidential campaigns, most recently for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. These ads, he said, are “all about Mike Bloomberg introducing himself to primary voters as someone who dislikes Trump as much as they do.”"
liberal,"Congress Wants to Force Trump’s Hand on Human Rights in China and Beyond
Lawmakers aim to pass veto-proof legislation in 2020 that would punish China over its treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims.
WASHINGTON — In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Republicans and Democrats are planning to try to force President Trump to take a more active stand on human rights in China, preparing veto-proof legislation that would punish top Chinese officials for detaining more than one million Muslims in internment camps.
The effort comes amid growing congressional frustration with Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to challenge China over human rights abuses, despite vivid news reports this year outlining atrocities, or to confront such issues globally.
To press Mr. Trump into action on China, lawmakers plan to move ahead with legislation that would punish Beijing for its repression of ethnic Uighur Muslims, with enough supporters to compel the president to sign or risk being overruled by Congress ahead of the 2020 election. Versions of the legislation, known as the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, passed both the House and Senate this year, but its path to the White House was stalled this month by a congressional process.
Human rights causes draw rare bipartisan support in Congress, and many Republican lawmakers have broken from Mr. Trump on the matter, even as they move in lock step with the president on nearly every other issue, including defending him against impeachment.
 “There’s been a sense by some that the administration hasn’t prioritized human rights in its broader foreign policy,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. “I don’t think that’s necessarily accurate — but that sense has grown. There’s been a sense that Congress needs to step up.”
Last month, Congress passed legislation by unanimous consent supporting the Hong Kong protests, forcing Mr. Trump to sign the bill. Mr. Trump, who had previously said he was “standing with” Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, risked being overruled by Congress and criticized as weak on China if he vetoed the measure. Still, when Mr. Trump signed the bill the night before Thanksgiving, he issued a statement saying he would “exercise executive discretion” in enforcing its provisions.
Lawmakers this year also passed legislation recognizing the 1915 killings of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians as a genocide over the objections of Mr. Trump. And they approved a resolution calling for the end of American military support of the war in Yemen, in which a Saudi Arabia-led coalition is bombing civilians. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.
In October, after Mr. Trump withdrew American forces just inside Syria’s border, paving the way for a Turkish military operation against Kurdish forces, lawmakers voted to rebuke the administration for the decision and show support for the Kurds, a persecuted group in the Middle East that has fought with American troops against the Islamic State.

In the coming months, Congress is expected to try to pass legislation that would punish Turkey and Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses, though it is unclear whether those efforts would have a veto-proof majority. The effort includes a package of Turkey sanctions sponsored by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. The legislation, which would penalize those who commit human rights abuses in Syria, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December.
Some human rights issues draw greater bipartisan support than others. China hawks have become ascendant across Congress and in the administration, and many Americans increasingly see China as a threat.
Although Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have criticized China on the persecution of Muslims, Mr. Trump has said nothing. In July, Jewher Ilham, the daughter of Ilham Tohti, a Uighur professor whom China sentenced to life in prison in 2014, joined other victims of religious persecution to meet with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. When she tried to explain the camps to Mr. Trump, he appeared ignorant of the situation and simply said, “That’s tough stuff.”
“It’s hard to find evidence of genuine personal interest,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “On China, at a minimum, President Trump should stop describing an authoritarian, abusive leader as a ‘terrific guy’; doing so gives Chinese authorities the opportunity to choose between that characterization and the far tougher ones offered up by other senior U.S. officials.”
Mr. Trump, who has criticized China over its economic practices, has refrained from imposing sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the camps for fear of jeopardizing the chances of reaching a trade deal. Many top aides and lawmakers from both parties have pushed for sanctions, but the Treasury Department has opposed the penalties. The Uighur act, which had Mr. Rubio and Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, as sponsors, would compel Mr. Trump to impose sanctions on Chen Quanguo, the top Communist Party official in Xinjiang, where the camps are.
In October, the Trump administration placed a few Chinese businesses and security organizations on a commercial blacklist because of their suspected roles in Muslim abuses, but many analysts considered that a weak punishment.
Other countries are more complicated. Saudi Arabia has been a traditional American ally, and Iran hawks in Congress, who are generally Republican, argue Riyadh is a regional bulwark against Tehran. And Mr. Trump’s positive declarations about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have spurred a gradual shift from the anti-Russia views previously held by Republican politicians, conservative voters and right-wing news organizations.
Mr. Trump expresses open admiration for many authoritarian leaders, even those condemned by senior officials in his own administration for some of the world’s worst atrocities. They include Mr. Xi, Mr. Putin, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.
“He’s celebrating the leaders who are the worst human rights abusers,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview. “It almost seems like the president’s support for you is directly proportional to how brutal you are to your citizenry.”
This month, the Trump administration blocked a move by members of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the human rights situation in North Korea for the second year in a row. Mr. Trump has expressed warmth for Mr. Kim of North Korea and has engaged in personal diplomacy, meeting him at two summits to try, without success, to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
“The Trump administration has sent a clear message to Pyongyang and to the rest of the world that this administration doesn’t consider starvation, torture, summary executions and a host of other crimes to be a priority,” said Louis Charbonneau, United Nations director at Human Rights Watch.
On other prominent issues this year, Mr. Trump used his executive power to reject measures that would have either punished countries for human rights abuses or simply affirmed the abuses were happening.
Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution that would have punished Saudi Arabia for its air war in Yemen and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and permanent resident of the United States. Mr. Khashoggi’s death last year — a grisly killing that American intelligence officials have said was ordered by Prince Mohammed — reignited a long-simmering effort among a small group of lawmakers to cut off American support for the Saudi-led bombings in Yemen that have helped create the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis.
Four of the six vetoes Mr. Trump has issued in his presidency overturned legislative attempts to penalize the kingdom. In May, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo sparked bipartisan fury by declaring an emergency over Iran that allowed the United States to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, bypassing a congressional hold on the sales. This fall, in closed door negotiations, the White House blocked similar language from making it into the final version of the annual defense policy bill, a must-pass package of legislation.
“I’m a big fan of the president on many fronts, but on this, someone has to stand up,” Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and a proponent of withdrawing the United States from wars, said in a floor speech in June before voting to cut off arms sales to the kingdom.
In another recent instance that privately confounded Republican lawmakers, the White House recruited multiple Republican senators to block attempts to pass legislation formally recognizing the Armenian genocide. The administration argued the timing of the bill would upend diplomatic relations with Turkey, including when Mr. Trump received Mr. Erdogan at the White House in November. Mr. Trump insisted on holding that meeting over the objections of some Republicans who have criticized Turkey, a NATO ally, for attacking the Kurds in Syria.
The legislation finally passed this month, days after the Senate advanced a package of sanctions related to Mr. Erdogan’s invasion of northern Syria and his purchase of a sophisticated Russian surface-to-air missile system.

liberal,"Why Bernie Sanders Is Tough to Beat
His supporters are loyal, and in Iowa they don’t really have eyes for anyone else.
GARNER, Iowa — Dawn Smallfoot put up a Bernie Sanders sign in her yard after hearing him speak in spring 2015. It’s been there ever since.
“Why take it down?” she said on a recent Monday evening, during a break from making calls to potential Sanders supporters. “I was waiting for his return.”
His campaign is counting on that kind of devotion.
With less than six weeks until voting begins, the loyalty Mr. Sanders commands has turned him into a formidable contender in the 2020 race. Despite having a heart attack in October that threatened to derail his second quest for the Democratic nomination, he remains at or near the top of polls in Iowa and other early states, lifted by his near ubiquitous name recognition and an enviable bank account.
His anti-establishment message hasn’t changed for 50 years, and it resonates with working-class voters and young people who agree the system is corrupt and it will take a revolution to fix it.
The scenario seemed unlikely just months earlier. As Mr. Sanders, 78, lay recovering in a hospital in Las Vegas, two new stents in one of his arteries, some of his staff members were unsure if he would continue his campaign. With Mr. Sanders, Vermont’s junior senator, already slumping in the polls, even some allies thought he should drop out and throw his support behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fellow progressive who was surging.
But then he secured the coveted endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, giving his campaign a much-needed shot of energy. In the debates, he was steady, loose and largely unscathed. On the trail, he began to display a newfound joy and humor. And Ms. Warren slipped from the top of the field, reopening the progressive lane for him.
Mr. Sanders’s revival has reshuffled the Democratic primary race, providing a counterweight to the shift toward centrism in recent months that has elevated Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and kept former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. atop the national polls. And if it lasts, it would add to the likelihood of an extended primary battle, with Mr. Sanders splitting delegates in the early states with several other candidates.
He still faces a difficult path to the nomination. Ms. Warren has siphoned off some of his support, and his entire campaign rests on the conviction that he can pull in voters who might otherwise not show up at the ballot box.
In addition, he has a strained relationship with the Democratic establishment, which remains bitter over the division he and his supporters sowed after the 2016 primaries, and chafes at his refusal to engage with the traditional party apparatus.
Yet in Iowa, and elsewhere, the tension with the party has served only to re-energize Mr. Sanders and his loyalists, who are faithful to him in a way that no other candidate’s supporters are: While backers of other Democrats often list three or four contenders when asked to name their top choice, Mr. Sanders’s fans are unwavering.
A recent poll from The Des Moines Register showed that, among likely Democratic caucusgoers who said Mr. Sanders was their top choice, 57 percent said their minds were made up; according to The Register, no other candidate registered above 30 percent.
Those figures alone could portend a strong showing for Mr. Sanders at the caucuses, where candidates must receive at least 15 percent support at a caucus site to collect that site’s share of state delegates.
“Bernie Sanders is definitely being underestimated in Iowa,” said John Grennan, the Democratic chairman in Poweshiek County, Iowa.
“Part of his durability is that he has 15 to 20 percent of the caucus who are absolutely committed to voting for him no matter what,” he said. “In a field that’s split between at least 10 major candidates, that 15 to 20 percent counts for a whole heck of a lot.”
There are other factors that have helped Mr. Sanders in Iowa. Because his backers are so loyal, opponents have been unable to penetrate his base, if they have tried to at all. Part of the reason is that Mr. Sanders’s strategy revolves around engaging people who typically don’t participate in the political process, a highly difficult group to target; even the Sanders campaign acknowledges it is a risky strategy. Another factor is sheer resignation: His rivals just don’t see the point in trying to pick off supporters who probably won’t budge.

Mr. Sanders has also mostly escaped aggressive attacks from his rivals. Other candidates have focused more on trying to stop Ms. Warren, whom they viewed as a bigger threat. On the airwaves, Mr. Buttigieg, another front-runner, has run television ads that attack Mr. Sanders’s proposals like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public college but do not name him directly.
Ms. Warren herself has rarely criticized Mr. Sanders. Asked at a recent stop in the blue-collar town of Ottumwa what made her a “better candidate” than Mr. Sanders, she responded tepidly that they had been “friends for a long, long time.”
And though Mr. Sanders’s detractors see a numbing repetition in his message, his supporters see his constancy as one of his biggest assets: Mr. Sanders, for instance, has absorbed much less criticism on Medicare for all because he has championed it for decades. Ms. Warren’s evolving position on how to pay for it has hurt her with some voters.
During a recent rally in Burlington, a town along the Mississippi River in southeastern Iowa, Mr. Sanders played his greatest hits. Standing behind a podium, he railed against income inequality. He trumpeted health care as a human right.
“What this campaign is about is trying to talk about issues, and bring about ideas that address the pain of working families in this country,” he said. The audience nodded along. Many had heard it before. Many had come to hear it again.
“I do like that he has fought for people the same his entire Senate career and even before,” said Angel Edwards, 41, of Burlington. “It makes you hopeful that he won’t flip-flop while in office.”
Since his heart attack, Mr. Sanders has often seemed lighter and more relaxed, a change from the gruff intensity that for years marked his public appearances. His campaign frequently posts videos of him shooting hoops, and he recently took a few pitches of batting practice at an event at an indoor sports facility in Burlington.
At the same time, there is little indication, in Iowa and elsewhere, that Mr. Sanders is attracting more supporters beyond those who backed him in 2016 and young people who were not old enough to vote then. In interviews with dozens of people at his campaign events in recent months, nearly all said their support dated to his first presidential run, or earlier; at events for other candidates, hardly anyone mentions Mr. Sanders as a top choice.
“From my conversations, it appears that people are not ambivalent about Sanders,” said Jeff Fager, the Democratic chairman in Henry County, where Mr. Sanders battled Hillary Clinton to a tie in 2016. “They are either behind him, or he is not on their list of potential candidates.”
That steady support could be enough in Iowa, whose complex caucus system favors on-the-ground enthusiasm, especially if excitement for other candidates wavers. The challenge, however, is that Mr. Sanders is effectively gambling that those who do not usually vote will now show up on a cold Monday night in February to participate in what could be an hourslong, sometimes disorganized process.
Kurt Meyer, the Democratic chairman in Mitchell County, in northern Iowa, said he saw signs that Mr. Sanders’s organization might have trouble turning out potential caucus attendees in his rural region.
“The Sanders organization in the predominantly rural counties I am most familiar with is not particularly strong,” he said. While he suggested that it might be easy to underestimate the totality of Mr. Sanders’s support, he also said it was far from clear that the voters Mr. Sanders was counting on would show up on caucus day.
Aides to Mr. Sanders provide few details on how they are wooing supporters, but they express confidence that their strategy is working. The campaign said in late October that it already had more commit-to-caucus cards, a loose measure of support, than it did in January 2016.
Just as it did that year, Mr. Sanders’s team is trying to connect with people in new ways. His campaign canvasses at farmers’ markets and outside drugstores. One field organizer, Conrad Bascom, has started holding phone banks at a Casey’s General Store in rural Garner largely because the location was a convenient meeting place and the Wi-Fi was reliable.
“It happened pretty organically,” Mr. Bascom said, during one such phone-bank event in early December. “It very quickly became a habit.”"
liberal,"The ‘But I Would Vote for Joe Biden’ Republicans
For some Democrats, a key part of the former vice president’s pitch is that their moderate friends and relatives like him, too.
CRESTON, Iowa — The voters at campaign events for Joseph R. Biden Jr. here in Iowa and across the country aren’t just shopping for a candidate for themselves.
As they jostle to take pictures with the former vice president and listen to him preach about national unity, they are often thinking about someone else — a dad, a neighbor or a colleague. They consider the political leanings of people close to them who are uncomfortable with the most liberal presidential contenders, but who hate the chaos of the Trump era and are receptive to the kind of centrist, seasoned candidacy Mr. Biden offers.
2020 CAMPAIGN
Biden says he has raised $22.7 million in Q4 fund-raising.
Some Democrats have been warning the party not to obsess over these potential swing voters, arguing that electability calculations about mythical undecided moderates are futile at this moment of extreme political polarization.
But for many Biden supporters, those voters are their Republican-leaning relatives and friends. And their perspectives are an increasingly prominent consideration as the Iowa caucuses near.
“I think he could get the independents and moderate Republicans who refuse to vote for Donald Trump,” said Bailey Smith, 27, a leader in Atlantic, Iowa’s business community and an undecided voter who attended a Biden campaign event on Sunday. Asked whether she had any moderate Republicans in mind, she replied, “My dad.”
It’s a dynamic that helps explain why, despite Mr. Biden’s series of missteps and uneven debate performances, many Democratic voters still believe the former vice president would stand the best chance against President Trump in a general election, polls show.
That’s a message Mr. Biden’s top surrogates are sounding at every turn, citing specific potential swing voters in the process.
“I always say that in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, if I didn’t have Republican friends, I wouldn’t have had any friends at all growing up,” said Christie Vilsack, the former first lady of Iowa and a prominent Democrat, as she introduced Mr. Biden at a campaign stop here on Saturday night. “Who will appeal to independents? And I want my candidate to be able to appeal to my Republican friends as well.”
Her remarks came just days after Mr. Trump, with his nearly 90 percent approval rating among Republicans, was impeached largely along party lines after he asked a foreign nation to investigate Mr. Biden. Republicans who have long had warm relationships with Mr. Biden defended the president instead.
For some Democrats, that development amounted to another reason for skepticism of Mr. Biden’s emphasis on bipartisanship, and his claims that Republicans might have an “epiphany” with Mr. Trump out of office.
Away from Capitol Hill, crossover voters are also a rare breed. But recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College surveys show that a narrow slice of swing voters does exist in key battleground states, as do voters who say they would be comfortable with Mr. Biden but not Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is more progressive. Mr. Biden continues to lead the national polls, too, though he has struggled in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this fall.
“There are a few candidates — Biden, obviously, being one — that could be attractive to disaffected Republicans and more centrist Republicans,” said former Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. He also mentioned Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Mr. Biden’s appeal to what some might call the “reasonable Republican dad” vote goes like this: He shuns far-reaching proposals like “Medicare for all”; he has a history of working with Republicans; his warm personal style is disarming; and he represents a return to what some moderates view as a more stable era.
A number of those factors are a liability among progressive voters, who are clamoring for bold change. But on the campaign trail with Mr. Biden, it’s the centrist Republican and independent voters who are often top of mind for his supporters as they think about the general election.
And according to a dozen Republican donors and strategists, as well as former elected officials who can speak free from concerns about retribution from Mr. Trump, there is some evidence that Mr. Biden can connect with these voters.
“Oh yeah, he definitely does,” said former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, pointing to Mr. Biden’s ability to speak to blue-collar voters. “He is a guy who can do it probably better than any other Democrat.”
Chuck Hagel, a Republican who served as defense secretary in the Obama administration, said he wrote in Mr. Biden’s name on the ballot instead of voting for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016. This year, he said, he favors Mr. Biden again, and would not back Mr. Trump — or Ms. Warren, or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — in the general election. It’s a view shared by other Republicans, Mr. Hagel added.
“They’ve said to me, ‘If Biden is the nominee, I will vote for Biden, I will not vote for any of the other Democrats,’” recalled Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, citing Mr. Biden’s experience and his empathy. “I don’t know how big or deep or wide that is in this country, but I hear it.”
At Biden campaign events, prominent supporters often instruct attendees to think in pragmatic terms, a stark departure from the fiery populist messages that animate events held by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.
“It’s not going to be you, it’s not going to be me, it’s not going to be the party faithful that turn this election — it’s going to be independents and moderate Republicans,” Chris Louscher, a Democratic activist, told a crowd at a Biden event in Algona, Iowa, this month, thinking of her brother-in-law in Florida. “I have a lot of family, a lot of friends, I have people in this audience today that are Republicans. They will vote for Joe Biden and that’s how he wins this next election.”
In recent days, Mr. Biden has been sharpening the contrast between himself and his Democratic rivals, using an addition to his stump speech to swipe at those who suggest that he is “naïve” for wanting to cooperate with Republicans — the very Republicans, he acknowledges, who are attacking him, his family and his “only living son.”
On Friday, a reporter asked Mr. Biden for evidence that Republican officials and voters had any interest in working with him.
“I think Republican voters have interest in finding common ground,” he said. “Wherever I go, there’s an enormous number of independents and Republicans who know and think we have to find common ground.”
It’s not just Republican votes that Mr. Biden is seeking. Several longtime Republicans have donated to his campaign and held events for Mr. Biden, too.
On Friday, Mr. Biden joined about two dozen people — roughly half of them Republicans — at a fund-raiser in Bel Air, Calif., hosted by Harry Sloan, a longtime Republican donor who supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016.
 “I’ve spoken to many Republicans who don’t intend to vote for Trump,” Mr. Sloan said. “They’re looking for an alternative. They are pretty polarized against Warren and Sanders and that so-called progressive wing of the party.”
“And when those conversations come up, they tend to say, ‘But I would vote for Joe Biden,’” Mr. Sloan said, adding that his event brought in $100,000.
Yet there are clearly significant limitations to Mr. Biden’s appeal across the aisle — and to Democrats’ guesses about how Republicans might feel.
Some Democrats in the Des Moines area said they thought Douglas E. Gross, a prominent Iowa Republican, would be inclined to support a moderate like Mr. Biden.
That was a surprise to Mr. Gross.
“They’d have to do better than Joe Biden,” he said in an interview this month. “I just think his time has passed him by.”
Then there was Marie Hansen of De Soto, Iowa, who said she was “95 percent” decided on Mr. Biden. But at a Sunday night campaign event, she also described a friend — a now-disaffected Trump voter — who has been swayed by Mr. Trump’s criticisms of Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter. Ms. Hansen wondered about “just finding that candidate she can settle with.”
Many Democrats argue that it is not enough to settle for a candidate who could appeal to disaffected Trump voters or moderate Republicans. They say that without liberal enthusiasm, the party can’t compete against Mr. Trump and his intensely committed base.
Polls show several of the Democratic candidates doing well against Mr. Trump in hypothetical general election matchups. While the Biden campaign and his allies are making explicit overtures to Republicans, supporters of his leading opponents note that their messages, too, can cross strict party lines.
Representative Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is supporting Ms. Warren, said that her “plan to end the corrupt system of self-dealing of the super rich is music to Republican, independent and Democratic ears.”
Mr. Sanders, who has gained in recent polls, appeals to younger progressive voters as well as some of the blue-collar constituents both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are seeking to engage.
“Iowans watched Donald Trump win by running as a fake Bernie Sanders, and they know the best way to beat the imitation is with the real thing,” said Bill Neidhardt, Iowa deputy state director for Mr. Sanders.
For all of the talk at Biden events about engaging independents and Republicans, Democratic attendees who hail from conservative areas tend to be the most skeptical that any Republicans are listening.
Dianne Ballard, 63, of Centerville, Iowa, said she thought that Mr. Biden could defeat Mr. Trump, but also noted that many Republicans negatively associate him with former President Barack Obama. Ms. Ballard, a Biden supporter, did not plan to press the case with her husband, a Republican, over Christmas.
“This is kind of Trump country, unfortunately,” Ms. Ballard said. “You’re either one or the other.”"
liberal,"Democrats, Citing White House Emails, Renew Calls for Impeachment Witnesses
With lawmakers at odds over a trial’s format, impeachment proceedings are in limbo.
Top Democrats on Sunday renewed their demands for witnesses to testify at President Trump’s impeachment trial, citing newly released emails showing that the White House asked officials to keep quiet over the suspension of military aid to Ukraine just 90 minutes after Mr. Trump leaned on that country’s president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The emails, released late Friday by the Trump administration to the Center for Public Integrity, shed new light on Mr. Trump’s effort to solicit Ukraine to help him win re-election in 2020, the matter at the heart of the House’s vote on Wednesday to impeach him for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
With the Senate’s Democratic and Republican leaders at odds over the trial’s format, Democrats seized on the emails in an effort to put pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell, who wants a bare-bones proceeding, has rejected a proposal by his Democratic counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, to have four top White House officials testify.
One of those officials is Michael Duffey, a senior budget official who told the Pentagon to keep quiet about the aid freeze because of the “sensitive nature of the request,” according to an email sent on July 25. An hour and a half earlier that day, Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to “do us a favor, though” and investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
 “What is a trial with no witnesses and no documents?” Mr. Schumer said Sunday during a news conference in New York City. “It’s a sham trial.”
In a statement late Saturday, Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the budget office, called it “reckless to tie the hold of funds to the phone call” and pointed to an earlier meeting in July where the suspension was announced.
With lawmakers home in their districts for a two-week holiday recess and Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer unable to come to terms, the proceedings are in limbo. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she will not send the Senate the articles of impeachment, necessary to bring about a trial, until she receives assurances from Mr. McConnell that the proceedings will be fair.
Mr. Trump, at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, for the Christmas holiday, was largely quiet on Twitter on Sunday until late afternoon, when he accused Democrats of precisely what they have accused him of: asking a foreign government to interfere in an election.
“The Democrats and Crooked Hillary paid for & provided a Fake Dossier, with phony information gotten from foreign sources, pushed it to the corrupt media & Dirty Cops, & have now been caught,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They spied on my campaign, then tried to cover it up - Just Like Watergate, but bigger!”
In a letter last week to Mr. McConnell, Mr. Schumer proposed a trial beginning Jan. 7 that would give each side a fixed amount of time to present its case, and called for four top White House officials who have not previously testified to appear as witnesses. They are Mr. Duffey; Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff; Robert Blair, Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser; and John R. Bolton, the president’s former national security adviser.
Mr. McConnell, who is closely coordinating trial strategy with the White House, quickly rejected the request. But Mr. Trump has said he is open to witnesses; with the Senate all but certain to acquit him, he is demanding a speedy trial to clear his name. In withholding the articles, Ms. Pelosi is betting the president will lean on Mr. McConnell to give in to Democrats’ demands.
 “If the president is so innocent and claims he’s innocent, why would he not allow, just like Richard Nixon did, the people that were closest to him to testify?” Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who is seeking the presidential nomination, said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”
Referring to Mr. Duffey, she added, “He says, ‘Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping the information closely held to those who need to know.’ What does that mean? What a great question. That’s a question I want to have answered.”
But Democrats say Ms. Pelosi is wise to hold onto the articles, because Mr. McConnell is effectively allowing Mr. Trump to plan his own trial.
“She is focusing a spotlight on the need to have a fair trial in the United States Senate,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said on “Face the Nation.” He said that was “especially necessary” with Mr. McConnell “saying publicly that he’s not going to be an impartial juror, even though that’s what the oath will require, that he’s going to work in lock step with the president, who’s the defendant in this case.”
But Republicans, in turn, have accused Ms. Pelosi of overstepping.
“I actually don’t think the speaker, who has great power in a lot of cases, has the power to decide not to send over the determined will of the House of Representatives,” Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said on “Face the Nation.” “They have voted. They have voted on two articles. They need to come and defend those two articles.”
At least one academic, Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor who testified as an expert for Democrats during the impeachment inquiry, has argued that Mr. Trump will not be impeached until the articles are transmitted. Republicans have cited that position in their demands for Ms. Pelosi to move forward.
“It’s a really untenable position, we think, for Speaker Pelosi to say, ‘This president is such a clear and urgent danger to the world, to the globe,’ that we have to basically trample his constitutional rights, to force a quick impeachment, and then say, ‘Well, we’re going to hold up impeachment papers and articles of impeachment to send to the Senate,’” Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“How can you possibly justify the contrast to say, ‘This is urgent,’ to then say, ‘Well, we’ll just have to wait and see’?” he added."
conservative,"McConnell Says Republicans Have Votes to Set Trump Trial Terms
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he has the votes to set the terms of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial without the cooperation of Democrats, which would allow him to reject their calls for an agreement on new witness testimony before it gets underway.
“We have the votes once the impeachment trial has begun” to begin hearing from the House impeachment managers and the president’s defense and to defer a decision on witnesses until after that phase is completed, McConnell said Tuesday after a lunch meeting with GOP senators.
The impeachment trial rules can be set by a simple majority of the 100-member chamber and Republicans hold 53 votes. McConnell said he hopes Speaker Nancy Pelosi will act this week to transmit the two articles of impeachment against Trump that were adopted by the House in December, which would trigger the start of the trial process.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer signaled that the time may be nearing to send the impeachment articles. He said Pelosi has “accomplished a great deal already” in holding on to the resolution because it thwarted any chance McConnell would move to immediately dismiss the charges and allowed a “cascade of evidence” to emerge.
But McConnell’s hold on his GOP majority hasn’t been shaken by any new revelations, including former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton’s offer to testify and recent leaks of emails showing the president’s direct involvement in holding up military aid to Ukraine after he pressed that country’s president to investigate potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son.
Despite demands from Democrats for a commitment to hear from Bolton and other administration officials and view other evidence, McConnell on Tuesday again insisted that the Senate use the same process as Bill Clinton’s 1999 impeachment trial.
Following the Clinton precedent gives McConnell maximum leverage because it would delay decisions on Democrats’ demands for testimony from administration figures including Bolton and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney until after Trump’s lawyers and House impeachment managers make their arguments and answer senators’ questions. That could buy him about two weeks to ensure Republicans stay united behind a strategy of blocking or limiting witnesses before he moves the Senate to a verdict.
The Clinton trial got underway exactly 21 years ago Tuesday. While there was a bipartisan consensus then on basic process -- including the amount of time for making opening arguments -- Republicans now are preparing to set the trial rules on a strictly party-line vote once the articles are presented and the senators are all sworn in as jurors.
“It would be better if 100 of us could do it, but the other option would be at that moment where 51 could act, that 51 would,” said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate GOP leadership team.
No talks have yet taken place between McConnell and Schumer to hammer out any kind of compromise, and none appears likely at this point.
Pelosi still hasn’t given any indication of when she plans to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a step that would trigger the start of the trial. Her allies argue that the Senate turning down Bolton’s offer to testify under subpoena would show that Republicans are trying to bury incriminating evidence against Trump.
Witnesses
“McConnell is making very plain he’s not interested in the country learning the full extent” of Trump’s misconduct, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Tuesday. “And apparently there are any number of senators willing to go along with that head-in-the-sand strategy.”
Schumer vowed to force early votes during the trial to call witnesses and documents blocked so far by Trump.
“There will be votes on the four witnesses we asked for,” the New York Democrat told reporters. “We are telling our Republican colleagues, you can run but you can’t hide.”
But GOP senators have been unmoved. McConnell’s lieutenants already are embracing his argument that it isn’t the Senate’s role to correct what he considers a “shoddy” impeachment by finding new evidence.
“I’m not sure it’s the Senate’s job to complete the House record,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican leader. “Our job is to pass judgment on the articles they sent us.”
Two Republicans who have on occasion broken with Trump and have criticized McConnell’s statements about the trial -- Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Susan Collins -- say they back his plan to follow the precedent of Clinton’s impeachment trial.
“I think we need to do what they did the last time they did this unfortunate process, and that was to go through a first phase and then they reassessed after that,” Murkowski said.
If just four Republicans want to hear from Bolton or anyone else, they can force an extension of the trial, but at this point no Republicans have said they would vote with Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents. Only Mitt Romney of Utah said he wants to hear from Bolton, but he stopped short of backing a subpoena to get it.
A partisan trial blocking fresh evidence holds risks for the handful of Republican senators facing tough races this fall -- such as Collins -- particularly if Bolton later divulges bombshell evidence or if other damaging documents withheld by Trump leak out after Republicans all voted in lockstep to protect the president’s secrets.
Some of those vulnerable Republicans, however, are expressing no such concerns. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who faces voters in November, said Monday he sees no need to add to the evidence assembled by the House despite Bolton’s offer to testify. Similar sentiments were expressed by other senators, including National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young of Indiana and Marco Rubio of Florida.
Young told reporters Monday it would create “a bad precedent if the Senate would try to improve upon defective articles of impeachment“ when asked about calling Bolton. “It’s not even something I’m considering.”"
conservative,"John Bolton Is Bluffing
If the former national security adviser has something to say, he could hold a press conference right now.
Noah Feldman is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He is a professor of law at Harvard University and was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter. His books include “The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President.” 
Has John Bolton had some sort of constitutional revelation? Back in November, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser made it clear that he would not testify voluntarily before the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, and that if subpoenaed he would go to court to ask for judicial direction. Yesterday, Bolton issued a statement indicating that if subpoenaed by the Senate during Trump’s trial, he would testify.
What changed? Although Bolton gave a constitutional explanation for his flip-flop, it’s difficult to see a coherent argument in it. The most likely explanation is politics: Bolton seems to be calculating that Senate leader Mitch McConnell will do everything he can to avoid allowing Bolton to be called. That would mean Bolton can now present himself as willing to testify without actually having to appear.
Bolton’s formal account of his change of position deserves attention — because his initial refusal to testify without a judicial order had a certain logic to it. The basic theory of Bolton’s old stance was that if subpoenaed to testify by the House, he would have faced a constitutional conflict between “a House committee subpoena on the one hand, and a Presidential directive not to testify on the other.”
This position rested on the idea that Trump’s orders to executive branch officials not to testify before Congress were lawful. I don’t buy that argument. The president has no authority to stonewall Congress or prohibit his employees from cooperating with an impeachment inquiry. The president’s blanket refusal was so outrageous that it forms the basis of the second article of impeachment approved by the House.
Nonetheless, going to court to get guidance wasn’t a ridiculous idea; while Bolton couldn’t defensibly rely on the legality of Trump’s order, it was plausible that he still should have been exempt from testifying. As national security adviser, his communications with the president could conceivably have been protected by executive privilege. The idea of executive privilege is found in the Supreme Court’s famous decision in the Nixon Watergate tapes case. It’s probably at its peak when it protects national security conversations between the president and his highest advisers — like Bolton. Bolton could have agreed to appear before the House and then asserted executive privilege for questions he didn’t want to answer. (Notice that Bolton still hasn’t said whether he would invoke executive privilege in response to some questions that might be posed to him in a Senate trial.)
But Bolton now says that “It does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts.” He concludes:
Accordingly, since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.
If Bolton can now “resolve the serious competing issues” on his own, why couldn’t he do it two months ago?
That’s not the only problem with his reasoning. Bolton also notes that the House has now voted and that it “falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments.” But the House was fulfilling its constitutional duty, too, when it sought testimony. The only reason the House didn’t call Bolton was that he’d already made it clear he would trigger a court battle that could potentially delay the impeachment process.
It’s possible, of course, that Bolton now actually wants to be called to testify. Maybe he thinks that history will judge him poorly for remaining silent. But if Bolton really wanted to tell his story, nothing stops him from holding a press conference and doing so.
Yet it is tempting to attribute a more complex motive to Bolton, who has always been known for his extremely sophisticated bureaucratic maneuvering. Bolton is declaring his willingness to testify at precisely the moment when it seems increasingly clear that McConnell and the Senate Republicans won’t agree with Democratic requests to agree on key witnesses before the trial begins. That gives Bolton the freedom to say he would testify, appearing superficially cooperative, while likely avoiding actually being called.
The upshot would be that the historical record would eventually come to reflect Bolton’s statement of willingness to testify, not his earlier refusal — all without Bolton actually testifying. That would split the difference for Bolton. And it would leave the American people still in the dark about what the national security adviser could tell us about Trump’s impeachable conduct."
conservative,"U.S. Stock Futures Tumble, With Investors Rattled by Iran Strike
U.S. stock index futures tumbled after Iran launched missiles at American bases in Iraq, escalating tensions in the Middle East that threatened to upend the global economy.
Contracts on the S&P 500 Index slid 1.3% as of 10:15 a.m. in Tokyo, after the Pentagon said Iran fired a series of rockets at two airbases that housed American troops early Wednesday morning Baghdad time. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index dropped as much as 1.7% and those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4%.
The sell-off shattered the uneasy calm that had prevailed on American equities markets this week even as Iran repeatedly threatened to retaliate after the U.S. killed a top general Friday, an attack that briefly roiled financial markets. Wednesday’s escalation rekindled the flight to safety after a two-day reprieve, sending gold above $1,600 an ounce and rattling equity markets around the globe. Oil surged.
“The market didn’t price the chance of a major conflict high enough when the U.S. drone strike happened,” said Max Gokhman, the head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “Now it’s more clear the situation won’t de-escalate and fear is replacing hope in investors’ minds.”
It wasn’t immediately clear if there were casualties or major damage, but the strikes heightened fears that the situation will widen into a broader conflict that could ripple across global financial markets. U.S. President Donald Trump had vowed a quick and overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks.
“It is important to note that President Trump was very clear that the U.S. would deliver a heavy-handed response to any Iranian retaliation,” Michael O’Rourke, JonesTrading’s chief market strategist, wrote to clients. “Futures should not only be reacting to the Iranian attack, but also to the clear escalation that will be the impending U.S. escalation.”
The S&P 500 is coming off one of its best year’s of the bull market, rising 29% in 2019 amid a cooling of trade tensions, signs of rising global growth and concerted central bank easing. Risk markets had looked past geopolitical tensions, from North Korea to the Middle East, on speculation central banks stood ready to continue supporting growth. Volatility that had remained tepid throughout the latter part of the year is now likely to spike higher.
“Clearly a myriad of uncertainties remain around a potential U.S. counter strike and any further reprisals which will subdue risk appetite and see volatility whipsaw markets once again,” said Eleanor Creagh, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets."
conservative,"Greek Leader Says He Will Discuss ‘Aggressive’ Turkey With Trump
Greece is getting worried about Turkey’s efforts to impose its authority on the eastern Mediterranean and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis plans to raise the issue with Donald Trump.
The Greeks are concerned that Turkey could start drilling for oil and gas in its waters after its neighbor sealed a maritime-border deal with Libya in December. Ankara is already locked in a dispute with the European Union over its exploration activities off the coast of Cyprus and officials in Athens would feel obliged to respond if Turkey repeated that maneuver in a stretch of sea recognized as Greek by an international maritime treaty.
Turkey added to the tensions by agreeing to send troops to support the UN-backed government in Libya.
Turkey is behaving in an “aggressive manner,” Mitsotakis said at the Atlantic Council in Washington Tuesday . “It’s unacceptable to have a NATO ally member provoke another ally member and this shouldn’t be brushed aside in the context of the alliance,” he said.
Mitsotakis said Sunday he will discuss with President Trump the dangers that Turkey’s behavior raises for peace and security in the region.
The Greek premier plans to make the case to Trump at a meeting Tuesday that Greece provides stability in a volatile part of the world, an official in Athens said.
Following the contentious maritime deal early last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan secured a one-year mandate on Jan. 2 to send troops to Libya following a request from its prime minister, Fayez Mustafa Al-Sarraj. The move triggered protests from the U.S., Italy, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt as well as Greece.
Turkish parliamentary approval for the troop deployment came on the day that Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed an agreement for the construction of the EastMed gas pipeline that will connect the eastern Mediterranean basin to Europe. That deal, backed by the U.S., provoked Turkey’s objections.
Any project that disregards Turkey “cannot succeed,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said.
“Greece won’t tolerate any infringement of our sovereign rights in our exclusive economic zone,” Mitsotakis said in Washington. Greece and the U.S. will also discuss ways to strengthen the strategic relationship between the two countries, he said.
Military Cooperation
During the meeting with Trump, the Greek premier will argue that Turkey’s actions are destabilizing and that Erdogan’s government has pursued a stream of initiatives that undermine western interests.
Mitsotakis wants to strengthen Greece’s defense capabilities by upgrading its U.S.-made F-16 fighters and will raise the possibility of buying the more sophisticated F-35 fighters with Trump. He also wants to discuss the possibility of a joint project to manufacture military drones and security issues relating to the roll out of 5G networks.
In October, the U.S. and Greece signed a mutual defense cooperation agreement that envisages U.S. forces using part of Alexandroupolis port, close to the Turkish border. Under the deal, U.S. liquefied natural gas will also be imported to an offshore storage and regasification unit in Greece.
The business-friendly premier will meet with investors during his two-day visit to Washington, as he tries to attract funds to an economy that has lost about 25% of its output during the debt crisis.
Mitsotakis will also hold talks with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in a bid to negotiate more room to maneuver on Greece’s budget.
Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a dinner for Mitsotakis on Wednesday night."
conservative,"Indonesia Will Not Negotiate Its Sovereignty in South China Sea
Indonesia will not compromise on its sovereignty in the South China Sea amid the recent sighting of Chinese fishing vessels near the Natuna Islands, which lie between Malaysia and Borneo, President Joko Widodo said.
Speaking at a plenary cabinet session in Jakarta Monday, Jokowi, as Widodo is known, said the increased presence of Chinese ships in the disputed waters since December was a violation of international law. He said in a statement posted on the cabinet secretariat website there would be “no negotiation when it comes to our sovereignty.”
Jokowi is scheduled to visit Natuna on Wednesday, according to Defrizal, head of communications at the Natuna regency who goes by one name, while the Indonesian Air Force had deployed four F-16 fighter jets to the islands, Detik news site reported on Tuesday.
Indonesia has also stepped up patrols in the gas-rich area, deploying five ships and two aircraft last week. On Monday, the navy dispatched additional warships to the area, Channel News Asia reported citing Commander Fajar Tri Rohadi, a public affairs officer with the First Fleet Command of the Indonesia Navy.
“This is our sovereign right,” Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said after the cabinet meeting, urging China to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. “Indonesia will never recognize nine dash lines or unilateral claims made by China that do not have legal reasons recognized by international law.”
The latest conflict follows accusations by the U.S. and other coastal states in Southeast Asia that China was taking a more aggressive stance on its claims to more than 80% of the lucrative waters in the South China Sea. China has said it’s operating legally, and has called on the U.S. to stop interfering in the region.
There were several reported incidents involving Chinese coast guard vessels entering waters controlled by other claimants last year, including one that resulted in a nearly four-month-long standoff with Vietnam. Malaysia also drew an objection from Beijing on Dec. 12 when it issued a submission to the UN defining its continental shelf.
Sovereignty Battle
The incident began more than two weeks ago when Chinese coast guard vessels escorting dozens of fishing vessels were spotted in Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone, the Jakarta Post reported, triggering the foreign ministry to send a diplomatic protest to Beijing on Dec 30.
China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the next day the country has sovereignty over the nearby Spratly Islands and their waters in the northeast, which had for years been traditional Chinese fishing grounds.
“The China coast guard were performing their duty by carrying out routine patrols to maintain maritime order and protect our people’s legitimate rights and interests in the relevant waters,” Geng said during a regular briefing.
Last year, the Indonesian government announced plans to develop the lucrative fishing grounds near Natuna in part to assert its sovereign authority there. It also pledged to build new cold-storage facilities to turn the area into a functional fishing hub by the year’s end. In addition to the navy, Mahfud MD, coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs, said on Monday 120 fishing vessels had been called in to further reinforce patrols.
“Aside from using your rights as a citizen, you are also obligated to help defend the country, showing that this is ours,” Mahfud said in a statement on the coordinating ministry website.
This is not the first time the two sides have faced conflict near Natuna. Indonesia has for years fended off Chinese fisherman caught poaching in its waters -- confiscating and destroying hundreds of boats. While Indonesia has sought to remain neutral in the wider dispute, Jokowi also offered a similar statement on Indonesia’s sovereignty in May 2016 following several incursions by Chinese fishing boats and its coast guard.
“This is how it has responded since the 2016 incursions. So if there was posturing, it was back then,” said Aaron Connelly, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Southeast Asian Political Change and Foreign Policy program. “Indonesian policy has been remarkably consistent on this issue.”"
conservative,"Why China Won’t Join Any Iran-Russia Coalition Against Trump
Beijing’s muted response to the U.S.’s killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani suggests China still isn’t ready to join Russia in taking a more direct role in the Middle East’s entrenched conflicts.
While Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was “highly concerned” by the action and called it “unacceptable,” he didn’t use words like “condemn” or “denounce” like his Iranian and Russian counterparts, Javad Zarif and Sergei Lavrov. Instead, he told Zarif that China would “play a constructive role” to help safeguard regional security and said on a call with Lavrov that “all parties” must uphold international law.
The comments were consistent with China’s past efforts to avoid commitments in a region where it could clash with the U.S. and its allies. Beijing has so far done little to counter President Donald Trump’s effort to ratchet up pressure on Tehran, beyond defending the Iran nuclear deal and criticizing the U.S.’s unilateral sanctions.
On Monday, the U.S. accused China of siding with Russia at the United Nations to block a Security Council resolution condemning the attack on the American embassy in Baghdad that precipitated Trump’s decision to order the strike at Soleimani. The U.S. mission to the UN said the move “calls the council’s credibility into question.” 
There’s little to indicate that Soleimani’s death will spur China to stray far from its past balancing act, especially as President Xi Jinping seeks to wrap up preliminary trade negotiations with Trump this month. While China has stepped up military cooperation with Russia and expanded ties with Tehran, it also relies on Iran’s rival Saudi Arabia as its top supplier of foreign oil.
“China is caught up in a dilemma where it doesn’t want to provoke the Trump administration, has a deepening strategic partnership with Russia while has its own interest at stake in Iran,” said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to China’s cabinet and also a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I expect the Chinese government to stick to a mild tone, calling on both sides to exercise restraint and refrain from escalating tensions.”
China and Russia have enhanced military ties in recent years, conducting joint naval drills annually and coordinating security policies across Asia through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Xi and Vladimir Putin have met more than 30 times since 2013, with the Chinese leader calling his Russian counterpart his “closest foreign colleague.” Putin has said Russia-China cooperation reached an “unprecedentedly high level.”
Still, they are unlikely to team up in a Middle East conflict. Although Chinese officials have repeatedly blasted U.S. actions against its own trade and security interests, they have opted for a lower-key response to Washington’s disputes with Beijing’s diplomatic partners. China avoided moves to stop American efforts to oust its long-time diplomatic patron Nicolas Maduro, saying only it was a domestic affair that should be resolved by the Venezuelan people.
Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of the Eurasia Group, told Bloomberg Television on Monday that China has a different objective from Russia in the Middle East. “The Russians actually want chaos. The Chinese want stability,” Bremmer said. 
Similarly, China has dramatically scaled back its purchases of Iranian oil since the U.S. ended sanctions waivers last year, importing less than 548,000 tones of crude in November compared with just over 3 million in April. China remains Iran’s biggest oil buyer, but it bought five times as much from Saudi Arabia in the first 11 months of last year.
It’s unclear what it would take for China, which boasts the world’s second-biggest economy and defense budget, to take a more assertive role in the Middle East. Last month, China hosted Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, for a visit to Beijing and participated in joint naval drills with Iran and Russia in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Oman.
“The Russians actually want chaos. The Chinese want stability.”
--Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group
Li Guofu, a former Chinese diplomat to the U.S. and director of the China Institute of International Studies’ Center for Middle East Studies, said foreign powers had few options to discourage Trump from his “law-of-the-jungle” decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. “In this case, other countries can do very little to possibly change the status quo,” Li said.
Trump has at times suggested that he would like to see Xi come off the sidelines in the Middle East, saying in a June tweet that countries like China should start protecting their own oil shipments through the Persian Gulf. China’s foreign ministry sidestepped a question Monday about whether the country would consider a larger security role in the Middle East.
“The worsening of the situation in the gulf is not in the interests of anyone,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing. “We oppose the abuse of force in international relations. We call on all relevant parties to exercise restraint, avoid the spiral of escalation and make efforts to cool down the situation.”
China could use its platform as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to criticize U.S. actions against Iran, a role that Wang Yi mentioned in his statement on the Soleimani killing. Still, Beijing would delay such a move for as long as possible, according to Shi, the Renmin University professor.
“China will not take sides in the UN Security Council until it has to,” Shi said."
conservative,"Stocks Plunge on Iran Escalation; Gold, Oil Surge: Markets Wrap
U.S. stock futures slumped along with Asian equities and oil prices surged after Iran started an attack on military facilities in Iraq hosting American troops, escalating tensions in the Middle East. Treasuries and the yen rose as haven assets caught a bid.
Futures on the S&P 500 Index dropped more than 1%, though moves did ease somewhat with benchmark U.S. Treasury yields off their session lows. Iran fired several rockets at two joint U.S.-Iraqi bases early Wednesday morning in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian military leader by the U.S. Japanese shares headed for the biggest slide since March, with equities also lower in Hong Kong and Sydney, while shares in Shanghai outperformed. Gold advanced to the highest since 2013.
“Markets will likely remain nervous,” Mitul Kotecha, a strategist at TD Securities, said. “Much now depends on the U.S. reaction and whether there is further escalation.”
Caution is returning to markets after a bumper 2019 for a range of asset classes amid signs hostilities are moving on to the next stage following the airstrike that killed General Qassem Soleimani last week.

conservative,"Trump’s Targeted Iran Killing Is Kim Jong Un’s Biggest Fear
If Kim Jong Un needed another reminder about the risks of bargaining away North Korea’s nuclear weapons program to the U.S., President Donald Trump’s decision to kill one of Iran’s top commanders provides one.
The killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last week reinforces the North Korean view that the U.S. only takes such actions against states that lack a credible nuclear deterrent. More specifically, Trump’s choice of attack -- a covert drone strike against a high-level target -- feeds regime fears that any U.S. offensive against Pyongyang would start at the top.
“The attack will only entrench the belief in Pyongyang that a nuclear deterrent, which Iran lacks, is essential for the physical survival of Kim Jong Un,” said Miha Hribernik, head of Asia risk analysis at Verisk Maplecroft. “Kim and other senior North Korean officials could, in theory, be targeted the same way in the future.”
The Soleimani killing came at a precarious time for Trump’s nuclear talks with North Korea, just two days after Kim announced that he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major weapons tests and vowed “shocking” action against the U.S. While the strike may give Kim pause about how far he can push Trump in the coming months, it also reaffirms the dangers of meeting American disarmament demands.
Those concerns have long weighed on talks with North Korea, which has allowed only a brief report on China and Russia condemning the “U.S. missile attack” against Iran to appear in its state-run media. The regime already had cautionary tales such as the death of Libya’s Moammar Qaddafi, whom the U.S. helped topple less than a decade after he gave up his own nuclear weapons.
 Just weeks before Trump’s first unprecedented meeting with Kim in June 2018, then-U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton proposed that North Korea adopt the “Libya model” of disarmament -- a remark that the president disavowed. Around the same time, Trump further complicated the Kim summit by withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation deal that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, reached with Iran.
That decision raised questions about what sort of agreement the Trump administration could reach with North Korea, which, unlike Iran, has already demonstrated its possession of nuclear bombs and missiles capable of carrying them to the continental U.S. Last week, Kim told a gathering of ruling party leaders in Pyongyang that he would soon debut a “new strategic weapon” and ruled out denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula “until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy.”
The Soleimani killing makes the possibility of a U.S. “decapitation strike” against North Korea seem less remote if the relationship between Trump and Kim further breaks down. The regime has accused the American side of plotting to kill Kim as recently as 2017, a claim bolstered by subsequent revelations that the country’s hackers had stolen secret allied military plans to take out the Pyongyang leadership.
‘Warning Sign’
Andrei Lankov, the Seoul-based director of the Korea Risk Group consulting firm, said Trump’s latest move will be viewed as a “warning sign” by those in North Korea who may have read his decisions to meet Kim and call off an earlier strike against Iran as weakness. “They will behave far more carefully with far more reserve than they would do otherwise,” Lankov said.
Although it was difficult to assess how the incident was being received within the secretive state, there was no obvious change in Kim’s behavior. State media published a report on Tuesday showing Kim making what appeared to be a routine visit to a factory site, unlike his late father, Kim Jong Il, who withdrew from public view for weeks after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Harry Harris, called on Seoul to send forces to help protect shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, saying in an interview with TV broadcaster KBS that it would be in the country’s interests because it imports “so much of” its energy from the Middle East.
U.S. policy makers have long lumped North Korea with Iran, such as when then-President George W. Bush listed the two countries alongside Iraq in his “axis of evil” speech in 2002. The National Defense Strategy published by the Trump administration in 2018 described North Korea and Iran as two “rogue regimes” whose actions were destabilizing their respective regions.
“North Korean state media often is implicitly sympathetic to Iran,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a specialist on North Korea at Seoul-based NK Pro. “It often cites the Iranian government’s position on foreign policy and weapons’ development issues, and criticizes the U.S.’s policy of ‘pressure’ on countries such as Iran.”
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told visiting North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, in 2018 that the U.S. “is recognized today as an unreliable and untrustworthy country.” Last week, North Korean media published new year’s greetings from Rouhani, repeating a long-held line that the two states are unjustly targeted by Washington.
Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. diplomat specializing in Korean Peninsula issues, said such symbolic ties would make North Korea pay close attention to how the U.S.-Iran conflict unfolds after the strike on Soleimani.
“What’s happening to Iran now must certainly make Pyongyang confident in the priority it has put on a credible nuclear deterrent,” Oba said."
conservative,"Wall Street Is Gaming Out All the Possible U.S.-Iran Scenarios
Investors and analysts returning to work this week after the festive break found an unwanted item on their desks: a geopolitical puzzle with a bevy of players, complex rules and no clear solution. They’ve spent every minute since trying to figure it out.
As the market turmoil sparked by the U.S. killing of an Iranian military leader eases, Wall Street is mapping out scenarios that range from retaliation by Tehran through proxies to tit-for-tat escalations.
The threat appeared to intensify Tuesday after Iran said it is evaluating 13 possible ways to inflict a “historic nightmare” on America, while dozens were killed in a stampede at the general’s funeral.
“The market is underestimating the risk,” said Fabrizio Fiorini, the chief investment officer at Pramerica Sgr Spa in Milan. “Investors are forgetting that equity is discounting a perfect alignment of planets in terms of monetary and fiscal stimulus and economic rebound and political stability. What happened in Iraq is suggesting that the planets are not aligned.”
Here’s a look at some of the scenarios money managers and strategists are considering, in their own words:
BlackRock
Base case: Iranian retaliation is likely; energy infrastructure in the region is particularly vulnerable.
Status quo: We prefer U.S. Treasuries to lower-yielding peers as portfolio ballast and like inflation-protected securities against inflation risks.
Escalation: We believe markets are underestimating political risks, especially in the Gulf, North Korea and in cyberspace.
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Base case: Tensions are high and risk is elevated, but Iran and the U.S. have constraints that likely limit escalation.
Status quo: Possible near-term Iranian retaliation includes attacks against Israel using Hezbollah, proxy escalations in northern Iraq and cyberattacks. Iran could pursue a more aggressive strategy, but the regime remains mindful of U.S. military power. Meanwhile, election-year politics likely limit U.S. engagement.
Escalation: The primary threat to oil prices is an Iranian escalation that draws catastrophic U.S. reprisal. Middle East military escalation historically meant higher oil prices, but as we wrote in The New Economics of Oil, even a major escalation would likely drive prices for only a short time.
Nomura International
Base case: The more likely scenario involves a retaliation from Iran, but not enough to spark an outright war with the U.S.
Status quo: Even if we assign relatively a high probability (of around 80%) to the scenario of no severe escalation and maintain our view that the positive themes of U.S.-China trade, improving global data and a bottoming of the semiconductor down-cycle continue, the risk-reward of holding our current level of positive Asia risk has fallen from what it was a few weeks ago. Thus, we reduce some of our outright short USD/Asia FX positions.
Escalation: The risk that the situation in the Middle East could intensify is undeniable and, if this occurs, it could lead to a further rise in crude oil prices and risk reduction. The sensitivity of major currencies to crude oil prices and global stock prices since October 2019 indicates that JPY appreciation is likely to become evident when crude oil prices rise during risk-off periods. Thus, in the short term, JPY long positions are effective as a hedge against the worsening situation in the Middle East.
Rabobank
Base case: A nervous waiting game is likely to continue as investors brace themselves for Iran’s retaliation. It is worth noting that gold is trading only modestly below the recent high and USD/JPY is struggling to gain a better upside traction following its recent fall.
Status quo: An indication that geopolitical risk remains elevated is Brent crude holding well above the pre-Iran crisis level. The sharp spike in oil does not bode well for energy importers. In the CEEMEA space Turkey and South Africa are particularly vulnerable as domestic factors are a major source of risk as well.
Escalation: Geopolitical tensions may escalate substantially in the coming days as Iran is reportedly assessing 13 scenarios to revenge the killing of Qassem Soleimani.
TD Securities
Base case: The reality is nobody can say with any confidence how the U.S.-Iran tensions will evolve. As such, the TD securities team would be keeping an open mind to changing the crude oil view should tensions escalate into 2020.
Status quo: For now, the recent oil spike is being faded as we take at face value Iran’s “promise” to stick to military targets and keep any retaliation proportional.
Escalation: The risk of increasing geopolitical tensions and a potential negative supply shock originating from the oil market could well mean that gold can move north of $1,600 should tensions escalate further, which also would help to send the rest of the precious metals complex to new multi-year highs."
conservative,"Gold Tops $1,600 After Iran Attacks Spark Flight to Havens
Gold surged above $1,600 an ounce for the first time in more than six years after Iran attacked military facilities in Iraq hosting American troops in its first retaliation to the killing of a top general by U.S. forces last week.
Prices jumped more than 2% after Iran fired a series of rockets at two U.S.-Iraqi bases early Wednesday morning Baghdad time. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps earlier claimed responsibility for the barrage, which the Pentagon said was launched from Iran and targeted the Ayn al-Asad base in western Iraq and another facility in Erbil. It wasn’t immediately clear whether there were casualties or major damage from the attacks.
Bullion is off to a scorching start in 2020, with investors in thrall to the rising hostilities in the Middle East. Prices are building on their biggest annual gain in almost a decade, which was driven in part by easier monetary policy by central banks and global growth concerns.
Spot bullion climbed as much as 2.4% to $1,611.42 an ounce, the highest since 2013, and traded at $1,600.95 at 9:28 a.m. in Singapore. Futures jumped as much as 2.5%. Silver also surged, while platinum advanced and palladium fell.
Investors will turn their attention to the U.S. response, the scope of which could depend heavily on the damage and whether any Americans were killed or injured in the strikes. President Donald Trump has shown restraint in previous attacks in the region blamed on Iran that didn’t kill any U.S. citizens, but Iran’s quick claim of responsibility for the strike and the targeting of U.S. military outposts make some sort of retaliation more likely."
conservative,"Facebook Tightens Policy Against Deepfakes Ahead of Election
Facebook Inc. has shed more light on its efforts to eradicate doctored videos known as deepfakes, addressing an issue it has identified as an emergent threat ahead of the U.S. election.
The operator of the world’s largest social network pledged to remove content that has been “edited or synthesized” beyond adjustments for quality or clarity and is deemed likely to mislead viewers. The new rules won’t apply to parody or satire, however. And videos that don’t immediately meet Facebook’s internal criteria for removal may still get fact-checked by more than 50 organizations the company has partnered with worldwide. Facebook will collaborate with Reuters to help newsrooms spot deepfakes through free online courses.
Facebook was widely criticized last year for not reacting faster to a widely seen video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had been edited to make it look as though she was slurring her speech. It took Facebook more than a day to label the video as “fake,” at which point its distribution was limited by Facebook’s algorithms, but the company didn’t remove it altogether. Dozens of Democrats signed a letter to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, accusing him of not taking the situation seriously and saying that Facebook would be “grossly unprepared” for the 2020 elections.
“Facebook wants you to think the problem is video-editing technology, but the real problem is Facebook’s refusal to stop the spread of disinformation,” said Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, in a tweet Tuesday.
The video wasn’t technically a “deepfake,” which would mean it was completely fabricated, but still introduced Facebook to the kinds of misinformation it will face heading into the 2020 election.
“We are strengthening our policy toward misleading manipulated videos that have been identified as deepfakes,” Vice President of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert wrote in the blog post. “While these videos are still rare on the internet, they present a significant challenge for our industry and society as their use increases.”
Other U.S. internet giants are also tightening up on content ahead of the elections. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is restricting misinformation and banning deepfakes in ads following criticism that companies ran ads from U.S. President Donald Trump that were intentionally misleading. Facebook’s policy details were first reported by the Washington Post."
conservative,"Sweet Revenge for Iran Would Be to Push U.S. Out of Iraq
Perhaps the sweetest revenge Iran could take for Qassem Soleimani’s killing would be to secure what the military commander was unable to achieve in life: expulsion of the U.S. from neighboring Iraq.

That goal has come a step closer with Iraq’s parliament directing the government to cancel a standing request to host U.S. forces, and the leak of a draft U.S. letter accepting the “sovereign” decision and informing of preparations for departure.
But President Donald Trump said Tuesday it isn’t the right time for the U.S. to pull out of Iraq. “Eventually we want to be able to allow Iraq to run its own affairs,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “This isn’t the right point.”
U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was adamant on Monday that “there’s been no decision made to leave Iraq. Period.” U.S. officials said the letter was no more than a draft and should never have been made public.
Adding to the sense of confusion, Trump tweeted a threat to impose sweeping sanctions on Iraq, if it should kick American troops out without compensation.
“Iran believes with good reason it now has a chance to accomplish what it has been trying to do for many years, to push the U.S. out,” said William Wechsler, a former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Combating Terrorism, who now heads the Middle East program of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.
Iraq’s Pro-Iran Militias 
Sunday’s non-binding resolution marks just the beginning of a negotiation, rather than the end of the road for 17 years of close U.S. involvement in Iraq, according to Iraqi legislators and analysts, as well as Wechsler. The irony, he said, is that coming after months of anti-Iranian protests in Iraq, “this is all happening at a moment when the Iranian influence in Iraq had been under the greatest pressure since we invaded.”
Islamic State
Any negotiation of a U.S. draw-down may first have to be done among Iraq’s different political factions, which break down largely along religious and ethnic lines. In a country that has been gradually rebuilding a sense of nationhood since the bloody sectarianism that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, Iraq’s minorities in particular see the U.S. as a guarantor against Iranian influence, Shiite domination and the return of Islamic State.

The vote to expel the U.S. was boycotted by most Sunni Arab and Kurdish MPs, passing by 170 ballots to none against in a chamber of 328 legislators. Even as parliament met, crowds that have been protesting government policy and Iranian influence since October were still on the streets of many towns.
In Nasiriya, a mainly Shiite city of about half a million inhabitants 225 miles south of Baghdad, protesters blocked an attempted funeral procession for Soleimani at the weekend, even as large crowds attended a massive ceremony in his honor in Kerbala, the site of a holy shrine closer to the capital. The Nasiriya protesters then set fire to an office of the Popular Mobilization Units, the umbrella organization that includes pro-Iran militias.
“Those who were out to protest Iranian or U.S. influence are Iraqis, and they don’t want Iraq to be an arena to settle accounts,” said one protester, Ayad Al-Rumi, speaking by phone from Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. “We’re working to build a new Iraqi state, away from all the plans drawn by other countries.”

Firepower and Clout
Like so many protesters for better government, from Iran to Chile or Hong Kong, they may not get their way, and their message -- which already drew violent attacks before Soleimani’s death -- requires increasing bravery. Iraq’s pro-Iranian militias wield significant firepower and political clout, and the U.S. remains deeply unpopular with a significant part of the population.
Since invading to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003, the U.S. has spent an estimated $1 trillion dollars on operations in Iraq and lost more than 4,000 troops. But the impact on Iraq was devastating, and the U.S. -- which in recent years often appeared mainly interested in countering Islamic State or Iran in Iraq -- is unpopular among much of the population.
 “The decision was based on saving Iraq’s sovereignty, security and interests,” said Ahmed Al-Asadi, a Shiite lawmaker who backed Sunday’s vote to recommend expelling U.S. forces. “One of its main goals is to spare Iraq from any repercussions that may occur in the region.” With Islamic State defeated, he added, that decision “should have been taken in the past.”

What happens next remains opaque. Caretaker Prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has indicated he will act on the legislation, but its wording is vague, making it unclear exactly what the consequences for U.S. personnel would be.
Iraqis have for years resisted pressure from the U.S. and Iran alike to choose between them, reluctant to become overly dependent on either. That has thwarted Washington’s more ambitious goals in Iraq, but also Soleimani’s designs for turning the country into a second Lebanon, run by a compliant Shiite party and associated militia, akin to Hezbollah.
Economic Embargo
Many Iraqi politicians appear aware that air power and training provided by the U.S.-led coalition has been vital to the campaign to suppress Islamic State, which at one point controlled swathes of the country.

 “Can the Iraqi government give a guarantee that it doesn’t need the coalition forces in military, security, intelligence and economic terms?” said Vian Sabri, a lawmaker from the Kurdistan Democratic Party. “Security-wise, ISIS still exist as an ideology and group.”

Many also recognize the risks of being forced by an enraged U.S. president to join Iran’s economically devastating isolation from global financial and investment markets.
“Anyone who lived the days of the economic embargo in the 1990s will feel the magnitude of the catastrophe that will befall us,” said Ihsan Al-Shammari, the director of Baghdad’s Political Thought Center and ex-press adviser to former Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi.

Even if a new government should implement the resolution, it could amount to less than it seems, according to Abdullah Al-Kharbeet, a Sunni lawmaker who described the vote as “ink on paper” with no value or legal consequences.
A dis-invitation to U.S. troops could still allow for trainers to continue working with the Iraqi armed forces, and for U.S. jets to fly counter-Islamic State operations from the northern provinces of Kurdistan. Monday’s leaked letter has added to uncertainty over U.S. intentions.
“People don’t want to be subordinate,” said Al-Kharbeet, “neither to the U.S. nor to Iran, nor even to politicians.”"
conservative,"Putin Now Needs a Plan B on Iran
Having to re-aim?
Leonid Bershidsky is Bloomberg Opinion's Europe columnist. He was the founding editor of the Russian business daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. 
Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, killed last week by a U.S. drone in Baghdad, has been credited with persuading Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene militarily in Syria in 2015, a claim the Kremlin denies. Regardless of the truth of that particular story, though, the inevitable escalation following Soleimani’s death has the potential to change Putin’s calculus in the region.
Commenting on Soleimani’s demise, the Russian Defense Ministry praised his “indisputable contribution” to defeating the Islamic State in Syria. The ministry credited him for organizing an armed resistance to ISIS long before the U.S. created its own anti-ISIS coalition. Indeed, if it weren’t for Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and other regional armed groups, it would have made no sense for Russia to enter the Syrian conflict.
Hezbollah and Iranian forces commanded by Soleimani provided the boots on the grounds that Russia was unwilling to spare, supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s bloodied and exhausted troops to turn the tables on Assad’s enemies, including the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. It was important to Putin that Assad didn’t stand alone. If that were the case, he’d be easier to write off than to back.
Some analysts have argued that it’s always been in Russia’s interest to limit Iran’s role in Syria, because the Kremlin has no control over Iran or Hezbollah. That argument, however, assumes that Russia wants control. Putin, for his part, never wanted to own the Syrian crisis, but rather to prop up forces willing to consider Russia’s economic and military interests ahead of U.S. ones. That meant maintaining the status quo — and from Moscow, the Axis of Resistance, not just the Assad regime, was the status quo. Alexander Zasypkin, the Russian ambassador to Lebanon, said this in a March, 2019 interview:
I’ll say it straight: The Iranian influence on the Syrian regime shouldn’t be restricted. A strong, unshakable alliance exists among Damascus, Tehran and Hezbollah. It’ll remain that way in the future.
At the same time, Russian diplomats and Putin himself have avoided calling Iran a Russian ally. To them, it was merely the central part of a geopolitical arrangement that they didn’t want replaced with a pro-U.S. one. That’s an important distinction. An alliance is defined by mutual commitments. But when it comes to the Iranian regime, Putin has avoided any kind of serious commitment. In an attempt to set himself up as a Middle Eastern mediator rather than part of one of the region’s warring camps, he’s cooperated with Iran’s arch-enemy, Israel, and with Turkey, whose regional ambitions sometimes clash with Iran’s.
Soleimani’s death changes nothing about this basic setup. All Russia feels compelled to do is offer condolences, as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif; express concern, as Putin did to French President Emmanuel Macron; and keep up its military cooperation with Soleimani’s successor, Esmail Ghaani. Putin won’t back any Iranian attempts at retaliation.
Yet he will need to react if Iran does retaliate and the situation gets out of hand. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has even likened Soleimani’s killing to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, the event that set off World War I. One possible scenario he described was an Iranian strike on Israel and an Israeli response against Iranian forces and proxies in Syria, which might endanger Russian troops. Putin has planned a visit to Israel this month; deconfliction in Syria will be one of the key subjects of his discussions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On a strategic level, further escalation between Iran and the U.S. might disturb the geopolitical balance that Russia intervened in Syria to maintain. That’s something Putin wants to prevent with the help of European leaders. In addition to talking to Macron, he has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to visit Russia next weekend, with Iran atop the agenda.
Putin can’t, however, discount the possibility of a full-scale war between the U.S. and Iran, a war the Iranian regime cannot win. In such a situation, Putin would need a replacement for the Axis of Resistance in Syria — some sort of arrangement that would make it unnecessary for him to commit more troops but prevent U.S.-friendly regime change, thus allowing Russia to maintain its military bases.
Putin’s options for such an arrangement are currently limited to working with Turkey, the only other strong player in the region that isn’t a firm U.S. ally. On Wednesday, Putin will visit Ankara to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They will have more urgent things to discuss than the launch of a new natural gas pipeline. Though Russia and Turkey have weighed in on opposite sides of the civil conflict in Libya, Putin and Erdogan have a proven ability to work together. Last year, the two cooperated when Erdogan launched a military operation against the Syria-based Kurds.
That Erdogan is Putin’s only possible Plan B doesn’t augur well for Assad. The Turkish president would prefer him gone, and if Iranian support ceases, Putin is more likely to seek a compromise with Erdogan than to keep propping up Assad. The Syrian ruler, ironically, must be praying fervently that the Iranians do nothing rash."
conservative,"Brace for the Unintended Consequences of Killing Soleimani
“The law of unintended consequences is the only real law of history.” So says my good friend, the distinguished historian Niall Ferguson. We are seeing the wisdom of that line playing out in the days since a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s most important military commander, Qassem Soleimani.
Certainly Soleimani was a dangerous, smart, determined enemy of the U.S. Taking his skills away from the Iranian regime is a tactical plus in the effort against Iranian aggression and Middle East terrorism. Indeed, Iran’s ability to respond to Soleimani’s killing is now handicapped — the best person to imagine, plan and oversee a revenge operation would have been Soleimani himself.
But this tactical success is not matched by an articulated strategic approach from the administration of President Donald Trump. Think of chess, a game the Persians refined: Trump has taken one of the opponent’s most powerful pieces off the board. Good. Yet there’s no reason to think he has a plan to ultimately defeat a clever opponent who still has many capable moves available.
And perhaps most concerningly, there are an increasing number of unintended consequences beginning to emerge — several of which could have a disproportionate impact on global events. So often, big doors can swing on small hinges. The effects of Soleimani’s death will ripple from Baghdad to Tel Aviv to Nairobi to South America.
Let’s start with Venezuela. Over the past couple of days, there has been an apparent inflection point as the corrupt regime of Nicolas Maduro has attempted to unseat the legally elected leader of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido. Maduro has used the typical heavy-handed techniques, including physically blocking Guaido and other anti-regime elected officials from the assembly, while supporting a regime puppet to lead it. Why is Maduro suddenly emboldened? In part, no doubt, because he knows the U.S. administration is focused on Iran, not watching events in Latin America closely. Unintended consequence.
How about East Africa? On Sunday morning, three Americans were killed in Kenya, the latest of a string of attacks against U.S. interests by the terrorist group al-Shabab. Members of the group, which is associated with al-Qaeda, stormed an air base shared by U.S. troops and Kenyan forces and damaged American aircraft in addition to killing one U.S. service member and two civilian contractors. Al-Shabab watches CNN like every other terrorist group, and is well aware that the “unblinking eye” of U.S. intelligence collection has of necessity shifted its gaze to Iran. Unintended consequence.
Then there is Israel, which faces an enormous threat from Iran’s Lebanese proxy force, Hezbollah, which has tens of thousands of surface-to-surface missiles directed against America’s closest friend in the region. While most Israelis are happy to see Soleimani dead, there is understandable concern about whether Iran will energize the Hezbollah missile force against Israel. The Israelis have many tools at their disposal to degrade that threat, but a massive rocket attack on Israel would change the strategic calculus of the Middle East significantly. Unintended consequence.
New drama unfolding in the Iraqi parliament will probably lead to the departure of the last 5,000 American troops from that very divided nation. At one time, of course, the U.S. had more than 180,000 troops in Iraq. The final tranche of military ground power is there primarily to destroy the Islamic State, but its secondary purpose is to be helpful in countering the strong Iranian influence in Iraq. One of the principal goals of Iran — and of Soleimani himself — was to ensure that the U.S. left the region generally, and especially that it depart Iraq. It will be ironic in the extreme if Soleimani’s death ends up ensuring his key goal: the U.S. finally exiting Iraq after so many years and so much blood and treasure lost, squandering its ability to shape events across the Middle East. Unintended consequence.
On Iraq’s western border, important operations against the Islamic State have been “paused.” Why? Because U.S. forces are taking defensive measures to keep people and assets safe against the inevitable Iranian response. This is prudent on the part of the Defense Department, of course, but it gives the terrorists a breather. And make no mistake, the embers of ISIS are still quite capable of flaring back up in both Iraq and Syria. Unintended consequence.
Finally, at the geostrategic level, there is the way the Soleimani assassination will be received in NATO. During my time as the alliance’s top military commander, it became clear to me that the center of gravity of the alliance is political cohesion. Now that consensus is weakening, as many of the member-states start questioning the legality of this action under international law. Germany has already suspended the rotation of its troops to Iraq, and the entire North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission there — to train the Iraqi security forces — is paused and at risk. Unintended consequence.
The lesson is simple: Before the U.S. makes a tactical decision to conduct an operation, administration officials and military planners need to think through the larger strategy of the chess match, which will continue long after a feel-good moment of killing one bad man. Based on what information has been made public and my own experience, I support the administration’s decision to take out Soleimani. But the consequences, especially the unintended ones, are going to set back U.S. efforts in the Middle East and around the world. You can’t escape the law of history."
conservative,"War Crimes? That’s Not How to Deter Iran
Even assassinating military leaders is bad for America’s long-term interests.
On Sunday President Donald Trump raised the possibility of targeting Iranian cultural sites as part of the ongoing conflict with Iran. He has since received plenty of criticism, but rather than just piling on — though I too think it is a bad idea — I think it is worth looking at the broader calculus of how to choose an appropriate target for retaliation.
Under current circumstances the retaliatory options include targeted assassinations, strikes at military targets, escalating cyberattacks, escalating proxy wars, and now attacks on cultural sites. (Tough sanctions are already in place.)
One reason not to strike at cultural sites is that it puts the U.S. government in some very pernicious company. The Taliban destroyed historic Buddhist monuments in Afghanistan to help make the country more Islamic. Hitler wanted his generals to detonate Paris as they were retreating, though fortunately they refused to do so. Such policies are now considered to be war crimes.
A second reason is that the Iranian government itself has mixed feelings toward those cultural sites. Some remind Iranian citizens of their country’s pre-Islamic heritage, while others in their splendor stand as reminders that Iran, formerly Persia, was once one of the world’s great powers. That invites unfavorable comparisons to Iran’s current status. Destroying those sites would turn them from implied rebukes of the current Islamic Republic into symbols of it.
Maybe Trump’s threat to attack cultural sites was not meant literally, but rather as a brash reminder that his retaliatory actions will not be constrained by world opinion, international law or the views of American elites. If so, such a signal, to be effective, has to harm the Iranian regime. Trump’s message shows that he doesn’t understand the calculus of retaliation very well.
Assassinating a military leader by drone, by contrast, is something the U.S. can do but the Iranian government cannot, at least not easily or without provoking even greater retaliation. That makes such a policy an effective deterrent in the short run, as it hurts the actual decision maker, and indeed that is what Trump chose to do.
By mentioning cultural sites, he in essence has decided to follow a very strong signal of action with a much weaker signal of words. If you are a hawk, you should understand that Trump’s talk of cultural sites is weakening his core message that retaliation will be effective. It is usually better game theory to follow up a highly impactful action with relative silence, but silence never has been Trump’s strong suit.
To be clear, it remains to be seen whether the killing of Qassem Soleimani will be good policy. Perhaps Iran cannot or will not retaliate against Americans right now. In the longer run, however, such decisions normalize targeted assassinations as tools of foreign policy. Over time, effective drones will become more widely available, and Americans will become more likely as targets.
In fairness to Trump, it should be noted that Barack Obama escalated such drone assassinations in several countries to an unprecedented degree, often killing innocent bystanders in the process. The primary difference is that Trump chose a higher-value target, but the logic of drone assassinations — if you accept it — argues for going after higher-value targets. Thus I don’t find current criticisms of the strike very convincing. The better argument is simply that both Obama and Trump have opened up a Pandora’s Box that Americans will someday come to regret.
And what about the other options?
Attacking or bombing military targets is an old deterrence standby, but these days it doesn’t seem to send much of a signal. Did the U.S. missile strike on the Shayrat airbase in Syria in 2017 have much of an impact?
Cyberattacks have been used to limit the Iranian nuclear program, and perhaps in other instances. But they don’t deliver an obvious public message. At any rate, cyberattacks don’t seem like the appropriate response in this case, given that Iran appears to have attacked the Saudi oil fields in September and was behind last week’s storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, both highly visible events.
Escalating proxy wars might be another option. But doing so would play into the hands of the Iranian government, which cares about those conflicts more than the U.S. does.
And so on the spectrum of possible responses, assassinating military leaders emerges as the best idea, relatively speaking, with targeting cultural sites as the worst. But the deeper question is how America got itself into a situation where the best retaliatory idea is still pretty bad, especially in the longer run. The point of retaliation is to protect your long-term interests. If effective retaliation is now a short-term tool, then U.S. foreign policy is in very bad shape indeed."
conservative,"This Is No Time to Snub Iran’s Foreign Minister
Last summer, when the Trump administration threatened sanctions on Javad Zarif, I argued that this placed too much importance on the Iranian foreign minister. He is, after all, a mere cipher in the Islamic Republic, a glorified spokesman for a regime where real authority is wielded by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Now that there’s a small chance of Zarif gaining an ounce of political weight in Tehran, it is doubly foolish of the U.S. to deny him a visa to attend a meeting Thursday of the United Nations Security Council. And that’s quite apart from the fact that such a ban runs contrary to the UN headquarters agreement of 1947, which requires the U.S. to allow foreign diplomats to visit the multilateral body.
A little background: Although Zarif has been the titular head of the foreign ministry since 2013, he has had little real power in setting policy. He was appointed to the post for the same reason Khamenei allowed Hassan Rouhani to win the presidential election that year: as window-dressing for a regime seeking to make a deal with the West.
Like Rouhani, Zarif had been Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator and had a reputation for charming Western interlocutors, in stark contrast to the dour, sour officials who characterized the administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Zarif had also been the Islamic Republic’s ambassador to the UN, where he was said to have developed useful friendships with influential Americans and an acute understanding of U.S. politics.
These qualifications made Rouhani and Zarif the perfect instruments for Khamenei’s top priority: to free Iran from the noose of international economic sanctions over its nuclear program. The two delivered on this with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
From that moment, Zarif’s utility to the supreme leader began to depreciate. Khamenei’s other foreign-policy priorities involved the expansion of Iran’s influence in its neighborhood, by destabilizing governments and promoting mayhem through terrorist groups and proxy militias. Zarif’s charm and credentials as a nuclear negotiator were of no value in this theater; this was a job for Khamenei’s main man in the Middle East, Qassem Soleimani.
Since May 2018, when President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the JCPOA and reinstated economic sanctions on Iran, Zarif’s role has been, in the main, to try to persuade the agreement’s European signatories to keep their end of the bargain. He was never going to succeed: Europeans fear Trump’s sanctions more than they covet business opportunities in Iran. 
The low point of Zarif’s career came early last year, during a visit to Tehran by the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The foreign minister was not even invited to a meeting with Khamenei’s favorite tyrant. Needless to say, Soleimani was. 
Zarif pouted and issued a faux resignation — on Instagram, of all places — but allowed himself to be persuaded to stay. His growing frustration manifested in his progressively more tetchy tweets. He has dropped his diplomatic pose in favor of snark, labeling the Trump administration as “the B-team” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “an arrogant clown.”
This playing to Khamenei’s prejudices — and to the peanut gallery in Tehran — helped preserve Zarif’s job, despite strong criticism from elements of the regime who regard him as a failure.   
Now, finally, things may be breaking his way. Soleimani’s death removes the main power player in foreign policy; his replacement as boss of the Quds Force, Esmail Ghaani, is at best an unknown quantity in that arena. Besides, Ghaani will have his hands full with the task of avenging the death of Khamenei’s favorite: If Iran does indeed have 13 retaliation scenarios, it’s a good bet that the majority of them will involve the Quds Force and the proxy groups that now fall under Ghaani’s authority. 
This might give Zarif some room to maneuver in foreign policy. And that room could expand if Khamenei decides to take the rational course and seek a detente with Iran’s neighbors and with the U.S. It would require Zarif to walk back some of his spiteful remarks and reprise his role as the regime’s charmer-in-chief, but this shouldn’t be difficult for a practiced chameleon.
That’s why it makes no sense for the Trump administration to bar him from the U.S. or the UN. Yes, there is an industrial quantity of hypocrisy in the idea of having the mouthpiece of a genocidal regime address the Security Council on the topic of upholding the UN Charter — which enjoins members, among other things, “to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.” But hypocrisy is the UN’s stock-in-trade: just run your eyes down the list of members of the Human Rights Council.
For the first time in years, Javad Zarif might actually matter: The Trump administration could not have picked a worse moment to make him a persona non grata."
conservative,"Is Iran a Rational Actor? We're About to Find Out
Khamenei's sole objective is to preserve his power. But he’s as likely to be informed by paranoia in his Soleimani response as he is by pragmatism.
Caveat emptor: Anybody who claims to know how Iran will respond to the killing of Qassem Soleimani is either a liar or a fool. The history of the Islamic Republic provides few meaningful pointers, because it has never been here before. None of its foreign enemies has taken out a figure of comparable importance to the Tehran regime.
No Iranian military commander of Soleimani’s standing was killed in the 1980-88 war with Iraq. The nuclear scientists assassinated — presumably by Israel — in the 2010s were important to the regime, but hardly as influential as the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ elite Quds Force.
The 1988 downing of Iran Air 655 by an American warship provoked similar outrage, but the military and political impact of Soleimani’s death exceeds even the collective weight of the 290 people killed on that aircraft. So it’s not safe to conclude that, because Iran never acted on solemn oaths of revenge then — “The criminal United States should know that the unlawfully shed blood in the disaster ... will be avenged in the same blood-spattered sky over the Persian Gulf” — that it will not do so now. 
Its response to Soleimani’s death-by-drone will answer a question that has attended every discussion about Iran since 1979: is the Islamic Republic a rational actor?
Plenty of smart people — including military men such as General Martin Dempsey, former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff — say it is. Other foreign-policy thinkers take the more nuanced view that Iran is rational without being reasonable: It has different priorities from those of its enemies, but its behavior is entirely logical in the context of those priorities.
My own view is that the regime has just one priority: its own perpetuation. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has demonstrated repeatedly in his three decades in charge that his sole objective is to preserve the peculiar form government that vests him with vast power over his people with little accountability. But his pursuit of that priority is as likely to be informed by ideology as it is by logic, as much by paranoia as it is by pragmatism. 
Consider the regime’s visceral hostility toward Israel, with which Iran has no borders and no history of conflict — and, indeed, a record of mutually beneficial cooperation until the Islamic Republic chose to make it a bogeyman. A pragmatic Khamenei would, at the very least, ignore Israel; only ideology, and an imagined enmity, prevents this.
Iran’s hostility toward its Arab neighbors has a stronger foundation. Many of them supported Saddam Hussein in the 1980-88 war. After that humiliation, the regime reckoned that positioning proxy militias within Arab states would prevent a reprise; this was dubbed Tehran’s “forward defence” policy. But Iraq’s decimation by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 removed the greatest menace to the Islamic Republic and gave Tehran the opportunity of a reset. That would certainly have been a rational call. Instead, Iran expanded its mischief both close to home (in Iraq and Syria) and far away (in Yemen).  
More generally, ideology makes Khamenei implacable toward the West, especially the Americans, even when a little pragmatic flexibility might benefit his regime. A rational Supreme Leader would see the long game in which Iran drops its nuclear, ballistic-missile and proxy-militia programs, re-enters the world economy, makes hundreds of billions from oil exports, and uses that to purchase the best military defense in the region — without loosening his own grip on power. Ideology blinds Khamenei to this.
Back to the here and now, a rational Khamenei would recognize that his promise of “severe retaliation” for Soleimani’s death can bring only more pain on Iran. War with the U.S. would impose a high cost on both sides, but the bill for Tehran would be many times bigger. 
Attacks by proxy, Iran’s preferred form of warfare, are no longer as safe as they were. President Donald Trump demonstrated with the killing of Soleimani that the fig-leaf of plausible deniability has fallen. Khamenei must now take on face value Trump’s threat of “disproportionate” retaliation for attacks on American targets.
Any strike on Israel would invite destruction not only on Iranian soil, but in Lebanon too, home of Iran’s strongest proxy. Netanyahu, his own political fortunes at a low ebb, is unlikely to avoid a confrontation with Iran. And he can be certain of full support from Trump.
Striking at targets among the Arab states such as Saudi Arabia would end the cautious efforts by those countries to arrive at a détente with Iran. And any attempt to choke off the Straits of Hormuz would hurt Iran’s allies — Iraq and Qatar — as well as cut off the Islamic Republic’s limited oil exports. 
The rational way forward for Khamenei is to stay the hand of his proxies and allow time to defuse the hysteria whipped up by Soleimani’s death. In the meantime, he would be able to continue improving relations with the Arab states — which, having peered over the edge, should be even more eager for parley. After an appropriate interregnum, he might use one or more of his Arab interlocutors to discreetly open a channel to the White House.
Of course, this would require the current occupant of that address to behave rationally, too. Trump’s threat to strike Iranian cultural sites makes it harder for Khamenei to do the smart thing. But it’s not certain he was ever going to. "
conservative,"China’s Next Crisis Brews in Taiwan’s Upcoming Election
As Hong Kong seethes, the island’s pro-independence camp is gaining strength.
As seats of state power go, Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan is jarringly humble. The parliament building, erected a century ago as an all-girls high school, occupies a rectangle of low-rise buildings in the center of Taipei, set back from the street behind a low fence. It was renovated only lightly for its current use: Aides work in what were once classrooms, and the former principal’s office now belongs to the parliamentary speaker. There are far too few offices for all 113 members, so many work out of even more utilitarian buildings nearby.
Taiwan is hardly a modest polity. Its population of approximately 23 million is roughly equal to Australia’s, and, with almost $600 billion in gross domestic product, its economy is comparable to Argentina’s. Neither of those countries, though, had a foundational figure quite like Chiang Kai-shek, who reigned as a virtual dictator from 1949 until his death in 1975. The Generalissimo, as he was often called, arrived on the island once known as Formosa under duress, thrust from China after Communist armies led by Mao Zedong defeated the forces of Chiang’s Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang. The civil war never officially ended, and for the rest of his life Chiang considered the Taiwanese state—which is still officially known as the Republic of China—to be a government in exile, waiting for the inevitable day it would reconquer the mainland. There was no point in building anything grand for Taiwan’s legislators: That could wait for Chiang’s triumphant return to Nanjing, the Nationalist capital.
Much has changed in Taiwan since Chiang’s day, but this liminal quality has never really gone away. By almost any functional standard, it’s a sovereign country, with a president, a military, a central bank, passports, and all the other trappings of a state. But almost nobody who matters in international politics officially recognizes it as one. Taiwan isn’t a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, or the World Bank. Its formal diplomatic relations are mostly limited to a smattering of microstates in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Even the U.S., its primary ally, has no embassy in Taipei, instead funding an arm’s-length American Institute that happens to issue visas and employ Marines.
Taiwanese Views of Cross-Strait Relations
Data: Mainland Affairs Council, Republic of China
While this arrangement is undoubtedly awkward, it’s served Taiwan well. By treading carefully on the subject of formal independence, the island has been able to develop deep economic ties with the mainland—which officially considers it a rogue territory—and turn China into by far its largest trading partner. At the same time, Taiwan has maintained close business, political, and military relations with the U.S., which serves as the ultimate, if only semiformal, guarantor of its autonomy. With one foot in each of the world’s biggest economies, local companies such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the manufacturer better known as Foxconn, essentially built the modern technology supply chain, setting up the factory networks in China that made devices like the iPhone possible. Along the way, these companies helped Taiwan become one of Asia’s most sophisticated societies: high-tech, prosperous, and, since Chiang’s Kuomintang (KMT) relinquished its monopoly on power in the 1990s, raucously democratic.
Yet as Taiwan prepares for elections on Jan. 11 that will pit the pro-independence incumbent, Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), against Han Kuo-yu, a China-friendly populist representing the KMT (which, improbably, has aligned itself with China in recent years), this model is under unprecedented strain. In Beijing, President Xi Jinping has signaled impatience with Taiwan’s unwillingness to accept Chinese rule, stepping up efforts to isolate the island from international institutions and suggesting it could be forcibly integrated. In Washington, meanwhile, the Trump administration has been working to sever China’s technology industry from the rest of the world, with a set of policies that represents an enormous challenge to Taiwan and could upend the business model that underpins its economy.
“The situation has changed. … Taiwan has to choose a side”
The campaign was unusually bitter even before the violence surrounding pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong escalated in the fall, riveting many Taiwanese and becoming a central election issue. The Chinese government openly reviles Tsai, who’s been targeted by online trolling and disinformation campaigns her government blames largely on Beijing. Her supporters accuse Han of harboring dangerous sympathies for China and being willing to sacrifice Taiwan’s de facto independence in exchange for economic gains. In November, Han’s campaign had to deny allegations, made by a Chinese defector to Australia who claims to be a former spy, that Han had received millions of dollars from the Communist government for a previous political campaign.
Voters now have an unusually stark choice to make—one reflecting the broader national dilemma as Chinese pressure intensifies. “I think many people in Taiwan realize the situation has changed,” says Jou Yi-cheng, a Taipei businessman and founder of a pro-independence political party. Eventually, he says, “Taiwan has to choose a side.”
Taiwan has been politically severed from the mainland for all but a few years since 1895, when the Qing dynasty, weakened by war and internal decay, was forced to cede it to Japan, which ruled it as a colony until the Second World War ended. Attitudes toward China remain the fundamental political cleavage. The DPP, which traces its roots to 1970s protests that opened the first cracks in one-party rule, is explicitly pro-independence and implicitly pro-Western; many of its senior officials were educated overseas and advocate closer ties to the U.S. and its allies.
Tsai was raised in Taipei by parents who ran an auto repair shop, attended law school at Cornell, and earned a doctorate at the London School of Economics. She worked as a trade negotiator for KMT governments early in her career, then joined the DPP in 2004 and was elected to parliament during the administration of Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP president of Taiwan. She first ran for the top job in 2012, losing narrowly to the KMT incumbent, Ma Ying-jeou. (Tsai declined to be interviewed for this story.)
The DPP gained new energy over the next several years, in particular from the Sunflower Movement, a student-led 2014 campaign to halt a proposed trade pact with China. Tsai won the presidential election two years later in a landslide, thanks in large part to support from young voters, who polls indicate are much more likely to identify as Taiwanese than Chinese. She also delivered the DPP’s first-ever majority in the parallel parliamentary election, and the party used its control of domestic lawmaking to implement a series of progressive policies—passing legislation, for instance, that made Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.
Even the most passionate DPP leaders act cautiously in their dealings with China, however, and Tsai has sought to avoid outright confrontation. Beijing has nonetheless refused official communications with her government and condemned her policies, which also include diversifying Taiwan’s economic relationships and building up its military. Last January, Xi took the podium at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, to signal a hard line on Taiwan, declaring that “China must and will be united” and that the task “cannot be passed from generation to generation.” As to how this might occur, he said that while “Chinese will not fight Chinese,” the government would “make no promise to abandon the use of force” to stop what it deems separatism. A few months later, People’s Liberation Army fighter jets crossed the midpoint of the Taiwan Strait for the first time in years, an especially provocative move in a series of military maneuvers there. Next, China placed restrictions on tourism from the mainland, drastically curtailing an important flow of visitors.
Tsai refused to change course, writing in Foreign Policy that “the people of Taiwan have not given in to the fearmongering of authoritarian regimes and never will.” She soon made a high-profile trip to the U.S.—technically a long layover on the way to see formal allies in the Caribbean, since Washington tightly restricts official visits by Taiwanese leaders. Not long after, the Trump administration signed off on one of her main defense initiatives, an $8 billion deal for advanced F-16 jets, over furious Chinese objections.
The KMT’s relationship with China is more complex. At the core of its philosophy is an informal compromise with Beijing that it calls the 1992 Consensus, which, unhelpfully, is neither from 1992—the name first came into use much later—nor really a consensus. It stipulates that Taiwan is part of China but doesn’t specify what “China” means, allowing each side to retain its own definition. This ambiguity is critical to the internal semiotics of the KMT, which has never renounced its claim to being the legitimate government of China even as its prospects of assuming power have grown remote, to say the least.
In practice, the party long ago made peace with its erstwhile Communist enemies. Its hostility to China’s rulers began to ease in the 1980s, and its leaders now espouse a policy of nonconfrontation, prioritizing cross-strait economic exchanges over political issues and laying the groundwork, however gradually, for unification. The strategy has yielded important results. Ma, who led Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, finalized a landmark deal to allow regular commercial flights to the mainland for the first time since the 1940s and also reached a broad economic agreement with Beijing. Not surprisingly, the KMT enjoys the support of many powerful businesspeople, whose investments in Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions depend on a reasonably stable relationship.
One of the most prominent advocates of this business-driven attitude is Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn and Taiwan’s second-richest man. A longtime KMT backer with strong networks in the U.S. and China, Gou announced in April that he would seek the party’s presidential nomination, citing as his priorities “peace, stability, economy, and future”—a list critics were quick to note omitted democracy or human rights.
It turned out, however, that KMT’s voters weren’t looking for factory-friendly pragmatism. Han defeated Gou easily in the primary, presenting his presidential run as Taiwan’s last chance to avoid a calamitous rupture in relations with Beijing. “The election is a choice between a peaceful Taiwan Strait or a Taiwan Strait filled with crisis,” he said in accepting the nomination. At stake was nothing less than “the life or death of the Republic of China.”
A few years ago, Han, a former member of parliament from a military family, was running an obscure government agency, the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corp., which acts as a wholesaler for farmers. In 2017 the KMT approached him to see if he’d be willing to run for mayor in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s third-largest city. A number of more plausible candidates had passed on the chance: Kaohsiung is the DPP’s heartland, and the campaign looked doomed.
But to the astonishment of almost everyone, Han won, leveraging a knack for baby-kissing retail politics and resentment over a local economic slump. The political elite in Taipei still had trouble taking him seriously. At one point, Tsai’s spokesman referred to Han as a tubaozi—a slur for a country yokel that translates literally as “dirt meat bun.” Han responded by holding a competition to find Kaohsiung’s best meat buns. He officially entered the presidential race in June, after a long period of informal campaigning that included a Taipei rally attended by tens of thousands. (He remains mayor of Kaohsiung.)
Han has an angular jaw, a thickly muscled neck, and a bald bullet of a head. He’s more polished than he once was—as a young lawmaker engaged in one of the Taiwanese parliament’s notoriously rowdy debates, he punched the DPP’s Chen so hard that the future president had to be hospitalized—but he retains a rumpled air. For an interview in November, he wore a mismatched blue blazer and ill-fitting black trousers over leather shoes that resembled slippers. A baseball fan, he opened with a joke about the Taiwanese team, which was vying to finish a tournament ahead of South Korea—Han-kuo in Mandarin. “I’m Han Kuo-yu,” he said, punning on his full name. “I hope Korea loses.”
He turned quickly to more serious matters. One of Han’s core beliefs is that Taiwan is an inextricable part of Chinese civilization, and he argues that it forgets this historical relationship at great peril to its economy and security. “There has been a calculated decrease in the connection our young people feel toward Chinese culture,” he complained, partly blaming textbook changes that emphasize the island’s distinct history. “Cutting off these connections to China does a great deal of damage.” In an odd extended metaphor, he likened Taiwan’s neighbor to the genie in the story of Aladdin, powerful and capable of delivering great riches. Compared with “the big genie,” he said, Taiwan “is very weak.”
Han was even more deferential to China before he became a presidential candidate, making comments suggesting, among other things, that independence was a prospect “scarier than syphilis.” In March he met with the head of the Liaison Office, which represents the Chinese central government in Hong Kong, as well as the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, the mainland body responsible for encouraging unification. It’s almost unheard of for a sitting Taiwanese politician to hold discussions with the Liaison Office, in particular, and some observers interpreted Han’s moves as a signal of openness to adopting Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” model, which permits limited autonomy under an umbrella of Beijing control. Such an outcome would please Xi, who in his January 2019 speech endorsed exactly that approach for Taiwan.
Events since have forced Han to explicitly reject the possibility. The Hong Kong protests, which began last spring in response to a bill before the territory’s legislature that would have allowed extradition to China proper, are one of the biggest topics in the Taiwanese campaign. During the interview, Han tried to straddle the debate, expressing concern about the potential loss of “economic power” in Hong Kong while urging Beijing to respect citizens’ desire for more say in their own affairs. “Many Hong Kong problems will be solved as long as true universal suffrage is implemented,” he said, referring to protesters’ demands to open up the city’s elections, which are held under a complex system dominated by government-friendly business lobbies. Free votes, he suggested, “will calm down Hong Kong people.”
The protests are clearly a more comfortable issue for Tsai, who presents them as evidence that Taiwan’s democratic values could never survive closer integration with China. They’re a big part of why most analysts view her as the clear front-runner, despite a slow start to her campaign. Such assessments don’t tell the whole story, however. A senior adviser to Tsai, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations, expressed concern about turnout, predicting that Han’s enthusiastic supporters will make it to the polls in large numbers. There’s also the matter of the legislative contest, in which the KMT stands a decent chance of regaining parliamentary power.
Han’s campaign has been fairly light on policy specifics. His economic proposals center on boosting Taiwan’s exports to China, along with establishing free-trade zones and creating a sovereign wealth fund. But he wants voters to be clear on one point: “Independence is the red line,” he said. “If the 23 million people of Taiwan came to a consensus and voted for independence in a referendum, they would have to deal with the military and political consequences.” In such a situation, “we don’t have any resources. We have nothing. All we have is talented people and a diligent fighting spirit.”
Rather, Han argued, Taiwan should seek to prolong the status quo for as long as possible. “I support the 1992 Consensus,” he said. “If you don’t agree with me, then don’t vote for me.”
For now, Tsai’s argument that Taiwan can thrive while distancing itself from China is being borne out. During a recent visit to Taoyuan, a city that’s home to many electronics manufacturers, a pair of bright-yellow excavators chipped away at an asphalt parking lot while workers directed a cement truck between stacks of foundation piles. They were building something Taoyuan hasn’t seen many of in the past few decades: a new factory, to be operated by Quanta Computer Inc., a Taiwanese company that makes hardware for Apple Inc. and others. After decades of rapid expansion in China, Quanta is reshoring production of some servers, pricey laptops, and additional premium products.
Although Tsai has sought to develop tourism, green energy, and other less established industries, the heart of her economic strategy is persuading Taiwanese tech companies to bring back production, especially of complex items for which China’s cost advantage is less of a factor. Her administration is helping manufacturers find space and providing cheap financing for advanced production facilities, promising, for example, to cover bank fees on more than $22 billion in loans. So far the effort seems to be paying off. The government says companies with overseas operations have promised almost $24 billion in domestic investment; in one recent example, Innolux Corp., a Foxconn affiliate, announced a $2.3 billion expansion of its Taiwanese production.
Some manufacturers haven’t needed much convincing, and not just because goods made in Taiwan aren’t subject to Trump administration tariffs targeting China. On Nov. 26 the U.S. Department of Commerce unveiled proposed rules that would allow it to block the import of any technology it deems a security risk, one of several measures designed to shrink China’s role in the technology supply chain. Although the agency said it planned to evaluate products on a case-by-case basis, it’s a safe bet that goods produced on the mainland will be subject to intense scrutiny. Nor have many Taiwanese companies’ experiences in China been unequivocally positive, particularly when it comes to protecting intellectual property. At home, says Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan, “they don’t have to worry that their technology will be stolen or pirated.” Other reasons for China’s declining appeal are more conventional. Rising wages and real estate prices have made it a much more expensive place to operate than in the past, and foreign producers now compete for workers with a large number of innovative local companies.
“In Hong Kong, universities have become battlefields. … That’s ‘one country, two systems’ for you”
Tsai’s government holds that Taiwan’s manufacturing expertise could let it become the hub of a restructured global technology industry, keeping advanced electronics flowing to the U.S. and Europe without much, if any, input from the traditional workshop to the world. “Before the trade war, the world had a centralized supply chain based in China,” says Kung Ming-hsin, a government minister responsible for future economic strategy. “But now it’s breaking up.” Taiwan, he argues, “can absorb these resources” if it moves fast. “We will only have three to four years to reshape our industries, and the outcome will decide our future for the next decade or two.”
It’s not clear, however, that this new strategic geography will be as kind to Taiwan’s economy as the old one. Taiwanese businesspeople were uniquely positioned to benefit from China’s economic opening, thanks to a common language, cultural similarities, and sometimes family ties—advantages they don’t enjoy in Vietnam or Cambodia, which are increasingly the destinations of choice for lower-end manufacturing.
There’s also the matter of Taiwan’s growing political isolation. In September the minuscule number of governments that recognize its sovereignty dropped to just 15, thanks to decisions by two Pacific island states, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, to switch their relations to Beijing. Taiwan has trade deals with fewer than a dozen countries, the bulk of them tiny economies in Central America. (Singapore and New Zealand are also on the list.) Tsai has sought to take Taiwan into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the recent trade pact that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico, but a successful campaign of Chinese pressure on any of its 11 signatories would make that impossible.
Taiwan does, however, still have its economic deal with the mainland, which many in the KMT would be delighted to expand. Doubling down on the cross-strait relationship and becoming a key player on the Chinese side of what could become a global economic cold war would in some ways be the path of least resistance, albeit one that could jeopardize relations with the U.S. It would also leave Taiwan exposed, even more than it already is, to a government in Beijing that will never accept a level of independence many Taiwanese view as fundamental.
In 2018 reports appeared in the island’s press about shipments destined for Chinese consumers being rejected by customs inspectors or pulled from shelves. The issue wasn’t that they were illegal or unsafe. Rather, the products were deemed unacceptable because their labels described them as “Made in Taiwan,” rather than the Communist Party’s preferred nomenclature: “Made in Taiwan, China.”
On a late-autumn afternoon in Kaoshiung, thousands of Tsai supporters streamed into an open field for a DPP rally. The party seemed intent on making a statement on Han’s home turf, busing in activists from other cities and bringing Tsai, Premier Su Tseng-chang, and a host of other notables onstage. Campaign staffers passed out little green flags with Tsai’s oddly prosaic campaign slogan, “Let’s Win,” written in English, while a rap crew warmed up the crowd and vendors dished out oyster omelets, pork dumplings, and huge skewers of deep-fried squid.
No one would accuse Tsai of possessing excessive charisma. She’s unassuming to a degree that can seem startling in a high-level politician, with a neat bob, ovoid glasses, and a strict uniform of black or gray blazers over light blouses. She delivers speeches in a near-monotone, as though delivering a trade-law lecture. But she sparks surprising ardor in her fans, some of whom mobbed her in search of selfies as she made the rounds of the food stalls. The reaction to her address, which began shortly after darkness fell, was similarly rapturous.
“Faced with pressure, our economy has to be strong, people have to feel confident in their ability to maintain their livelihoods, and our defense and diplomatic relations have to be maintained,” she said from the podium, waving her right hand up and down for emphasis. “We don’t aim to conquer the universe. Taiwanese people just want to use their own power to protect sovereignty and safeguard democracy.” The danger to both, she argued, is evident in Hong Kong. “China is promoting a Taiwan version of the ‘one country, two systems’ policy. But now in Hong Kong, universities have become battlefields, some people have suddenly gone missing, some people have died.” She continued: “That’s ‘one country, two systems’ for you. Can you accept that? Can you accept that? We will state very clearly: We will never, ever accept that.”
Even if Tsai wins a second term, there’s little chance she’ll end Taiwan’s 70-year political limbo. But for many of her supporters, especially the young, the argument over the island’s identity is already settled. That was the case for Sunny Lin, a 26-year-old auto parts worker who drove an hour to the rally. “It will take time to reach formal status, but we need to at least try,” she said, standing on the edge of the crowd. “We will never belong to China. For me, Taiwan has been a country for a long time.” "
conservative,"Eight Ways Wine Will Change in 2020
The 2010s saw the rise of serious global concern (at last!) about the effect of climate change on wine. That will continue big time, especially with 2019’s scorching heat waves in France and catastrophic fires in Sonoma, Calif., and South Australia.
ADVERTISING
The rosé juggernaut of the past decade continues, as luxury players move in to Provence. LVMH acquired two rosé producers last year, including a majority share of Château d’Esclans, maker of ubiquitous Whispering Angel. Chanel, owner of three Bordeaux châteaux, snapped up Domaine de l’Ile.
Natural wine captured the zeitgeist of the decade, which ended with trade wars slamming wine in the form of U.S. tariffs on French, German, and Spanish reds and whites, with the uncertainty of more to come in 2020. Brexit is still a problem, and wine caves, once a major tourism attraction in Napa, Calif., turned into political footballs. (Tip for cave owners: Don’t turn on the chandelier.)
Hard seltzer also captured hearts, minds, and tongues this past year, with sales surging 210% in the U.S. To my dismay, they’re poised to triple by 2023, according to the drinks market analysts at IWSR. Why not make wine spritzers?
On the plus side, fizz continues to effervesce, even though the French are drinking much less Champagne. To supply ever-increasing global demand (and at lower prices), Brazil, California, New Zealand, Oregon, and Tasmania are producing better sparklers than ever.
At least, unlike the roaring ’20s of a century ago, 2020 won’t begin with Prohibition.
Here’s what else I see in my crystal glass for 2020:
Global warming will ramp up wine experiments everywhere
You’ll see the bottled results of dozens of experiments, and more will be started. Sparkling wine from Nova Scotia? Definitely. Historic and new hybrid grapes that can cope with heat better? Spain’s Torres winery is on it; ditto Bordeaux, Champagne, and Napa. Fresher, brighter whites from high-altitude vineyards? Look to Chile and Argentina, including even the cold extremities of Patagonia.
Unfussy piquette will become a thing
Casual, low-cost, and low-alcohol drinks that offer gluggable simplicity are having a moment, and they’ll be even more important in 2020.
The fashion for pét-nats (pétillant naturel wines) and even hard seltzer (ugh!) are part of this trend. The latest addition is piquette, a worker’s drink popular centuries ago. Not technically a wine, it’s made by fermenting pomace—the leftover skins, seeds, and stems of grapes—to create a drink that’s 4% to 9% in alcohol with light bubbles to perk it up. It’s zippy and refreshing, akin to a sour beer. Wild Arc Farm in the Hudson Valley released four in 2019, including one in cans.
The past decade has seen wineries experiment with aging their wines under the sea. For 2020 and beyond, they’ll look to space.
This past November, Luxembourg-based Space Cargo Unlimited started a project that sent bottles of red wine to the International Space Station to be aged for 12 months. The idea is to investigate how exposure to more radiation and microgravity affect the evolution of a wine’s components. When the wine returns, the University of Bordeaux will analyze it and compare it with wines aged on Earth.
The no- and low-alcohol movement will gain a foothold 
The health and wellness craze will affect wine beyond the idea of “Dry January.” Cutting back on how much you imbibe will be one of the biggest drinks trends of 2020, according to London-based retailer Bibendum. Alcohol-free Real Kombucha, introduced in 2017, is now available at more than 50 Michelin-starred restaurants and touted as an alternative to sauvignon blanc.
Expect a boost of interest in organic and biodynamic wines—“health-focused” wine club Dry Farm Wines claims its offerings are all-natural and lab-tested for purity—as well as those naturally low in alcohol, such as riesling, lightly fizzy Spanish txakoli, and slightly sweet Italian moscato d’Asti. All are far more delicious and just as healthy as wines from “clean wine” companies such as FitVine. 
Insert token, receive a small bottle of Moët & Chandon brut or rosé. What could be simpler? Nabbing a bottle at a test machine in the Ritz-Carlton in Naples, Fla., was cheaper, more convenient, and more fun than waiting for room service. New York got its first machine in October, and in 2020 Moët plans to spread 100 of them across the U.S. (You can even buy your own—$35,000 at Neiman Marcus—but stocking it with 360 mini-bottles costs extra.)
The machines reflect the growing demand for instant access, even for luxury wines. Expect other wine companies to jump on this bandwagon. But because of France’s alcohol laws, don’t look for one in Paris.
For starters, a €100 million ($112 million) World of Wine project is opening in 2020 across the Douro River from the city of Porto. The Fladgate Partnership, owner of several top port houses, is transforming 300-year-old warehouses into a series of wine experiences including a wine school and cork museum.
In France, Champagne Bollinger is opening its doors to the public via membership in its special Club 1829, Château Lafite Rothschild will open a new hospitality center and wine school at Château Duhart-Milon in time for harvest, and Burgundy breaks ground this month on its own Cité des Vins.
But the most interesting new wine travel development is the global DIY winemaking timeshare the Vines Global. Membership will let aspiring vineyard owners test their mettle making wine in a dozen regions with top winemakers. It started in Tuscany’s Montalcino last September; next year it will add Priorat, Spain, and two other places, with more to come.
Just want to see vineyards? The World’s Best Vineyards, a new annual ranking of the 50 most amazing ones to visit, will help you know where to go.
Wine packaging will surprise you
No longer a fad, canned wines are expected to reach sales of $4.6 billion by 2024. Now that canning has been normalized, and higher-quality wines skip the traditional glass bottle, keep a lookout for ever more innovative packaging: refillable, reusable jugs and flat bottles made from recycled plastic, as well as green-friendly components such as zero-carbon corks.
As for the staid wine label, more than 500 wineries across the globe are turning to augmented reality to bring labels to life through apps. And in Washington state, Chateau Ste. Michelle’s new Elicit Wine Project will act as an innovation hub for brands to take an info-rich, creative look at names, labels, and bottle design; for instance, its Fruit & Flower brand comes in both cans and bottles with themed label images to mirror the flavors of the wine inside.
Wine shops will become less conventional
U.K. department store John Lewis has added bookable wine master classes. Stranger Wines in Brooklyn, N.Y., plays vintage vinyl records and is expanding to snacks, and Manhattan’s just-opened Peoples is a wine bar that doubles as a retail wine shop, even if they have to have separate entrances because of liquor laws.
Nielsen predicts AR and virtual reality technology will transform wine shops with navigation apps and electronic shelf beacons. The future will surely bring artificial intelligence-powered robot assistants. At the same time, buying online via phone apps will soar, again helped along by new technology.
But as the year progresses, I still have plenty of questions. Will wine lovers continue to lust after the wines LeBron James posts on Instagram? Will interactive wine lists on tablets take over in Michelin-starred restaurants? Will South Africa be the value region of the year? I’ll be watching and reporting on these stories and many more in 2020."
conservative,"Voters in Asia’s Brightest ‘Tiger’ Economy Face a Tricky Choice

Taiwan’s economic performance could act as a tiebreaker for undecided voters choosing a candidate in this weekend’s election, with the recent successes during President Tsai Ing-wen’s term offset by frustration at slower-than-expected progress in boosting the incomes of ordinary citizens.
While Tsai has overseen faster growth, a surge in investment and buoyant financial markets since she took office in 2016, there are concerns hidden under the rosy data. Here are four charts summarizing the outlook as she faces the challenge from Han Kuo-yu of the more China-friendly Kuomintang, and James Soong of People First Party this Saturday.
Taiwan has emerged as a surprise winner of the U.S.-China trade war, as the economy benefits from re-shoring of investment by companies previously embedded in China. Full year output growth for 2019 is set to come in at 2.5%, according to the median of economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mean Taiwan tops the four “Asian Tiger” economies for the first time since 2014.
The island’s income-per-person level remains a long-standing challenge. While Tsai has overseen the fastest income growth in 20 years, it is still the lowest of the four, which has fueled criticism of Tsai from her challenger Han Kuo-yu.
Taiwan’s income level is expected to have risen to $24,828 as of the end of 2019, lower than South Korea’s $31,431, Hong Kong’s $49,334, and Singapore’s $63,987, according to International Monetary Fund data. Taiwan’s income per capita has only grown 67% from end-2000 to 2019, compared with 93% for Hong Kong, 156% for South Korea, and 168% for Singapore over the same period.
While concrete proposals remain scarce, Han has promised to increase exports of agricultural products, boost tourists from China, and to establish free economic zones as part of his plan to bolster the economy.
Taiwan’s job market has been stable. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.97% before President Tsai took office in 2016 and has trended lower afterward, reaching a record low of 3.69% twice. Its November reading was steady at 3.73%.
The lower jobless rate may be partly due to fewer job seekers in the market, as postwar baby-boomers are retiring and Taiwan grapples with an aging society. Taiwan may see a declining population as soon as 2022, according to an estimate from the island’s National Development Council. That’s three years earlier than its previous estimate.
Strong Inflow
Reshoring of investment is seen continuing this year
Source: Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs
Tsai’s most prominent achievement could be the policies to boost investment. Local firms have been encouraged to invest at home, as the U.S.-China trade war accelerates manufacturing relocation and helps Taiwan retake a slice of the global technology supply chain.
Over NT$700 billion of investment has been approved as of January 3 from the re-shoring program, according to government data.
Investment in place is estimated to reach NT$225.5 billion at end-2019, NT$213.3 billion in 2020, and NT$183.1 billion in 2021, according to estimates from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. It means investment momentum will continue this and next year, though lower than the peak in 2019.
Foreign firms such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. and wind power company Orsted A/S have also recently won government approval to invest in local projects."
conservative,"U.S. Suspects Iran Reprisal Deliberately Missed American Troops
Iran apparently intended to avoid U.S. casualties when it launched more than a dozen missiles at U.S.-Iraqi airbases in retaliation for an American airstrike that killed a top Iranian general, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.
U.S. assessments of the strikes indicate Iran may have been aiming at unpopulated areas of the sprawling Al Asad airbase, because precision guided missiles struck sandy areas, said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information wasn’t yet publicly announced. The absence of U.S. casualties could mitigate the potential for a dramatic escalation.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility for the barrage, which the Pentagon said was launched from Iran, and warned that additional operations were being prepared. At the same time, there were signs that both sides wanted to pull back from the brink of conflict, with Iran’s foreign minister saying his country didn’t wish to go to war, and Trump pronouncing that “All is well.”
The Pentagon said that Al Asad and the base near Erbil that were struck had already been on high alert, and Iraq said it had received prior warning from Iran of an assault. No U.S. or Iraqi casualties were reported.
Stocks dropped and oil rose, though crude later pared gains on the reassuring signals. Major tanker companies, however, including Petrobas Brasileiro SA and the National Shipping Co. of Saudi Arabia, suspended sailing through the Straits of Hormuz, a major oil waterway, Dow Jones reported.
Some sort of response had been expected to the killing last week of Qassem Soleimani, who ran Iran’s proxy operations across the Middle East and was killed in a drone strike near the airport in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. While Tehran doesn’t want outright war with the U.S., there was growing pressure at home to react. The balancing act was to do so without tipping things into a conflict that no one has appetite for.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the attacks on the bases as a “crushing response.”
“Last night, they got a slap in the face,” he said on state television. He again demanded that the U.S. presence in the region come to an end, a sign that Tehran’s ultimate goal remains to push the U.S. military out of Iraq.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sounded more conciliatory. The government “concluded proportionate measures in self-defense” after the Soleimani strike, he said on Twitter. “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.”
Iran has for years operated a carefully calibrated strategy of attacks, often via proxies, in the Middle East, that preserves its influence without drawing major retaliation. Crippled by economic sanctions, it can ill afford an outright war.
Iran “needed to do something quick,” said Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Center for Global Policy in Washington. “This is a placeholder move and a low-cost one.”
One White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the early thinking was the missile strike was a perfunctory move that would let Iran retaliate without incurring a potentially devastating U.S. counter-assault. Trump is scheduled to make a statement later Wednesday.
Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have soared under Trump, who walked away from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, approved by his predecessor. Since then, Iran has retreated from limitations on its nuclear program.
Iran’s attack sent futures on the S&P 500 Index down as much as 1.7% before paring losses. Gold initially advanced to the highest since 2013, though those gains were trimmed along with an advance in oil, which at one point surged above $65 a barrel.
The Iraqi prime minister’s office said it received verbal notice from Iran before the strike. It said 22 missiles entered Iraqi airspace early Wednesday, and 17 hit Ayn al-Asad, a key U.S. facility in the country that’s been visited by both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
The tensions disrupted flights, with U.S. aviation regulators issuing new restrictions barring civilian traffic over Iraq, Iran, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Adding to the turmoil, a Boeing Co. 737 passenger jet bound for Ukraine crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran, killing all 176 people on board, with Iran’s media reporting it was due to a technical problem.
World leaders urged restraint, and Turkey indicated it’s willing to mediate between the U.S. and Iran. Ankara has cordial relations with eastern neighbor Iran, and enjoys warm ties with Trump, despite severe strains with Congress over a Russian missile purchase.
Trump has shown restraint in previous attacks in the region blamed on Iran that didn’t kill any U.S. citizens. But Iran’s quick claim of responsibility and the targeting of U.S. military outposts make some sort of retaliation more likely.
“The next question is, does the U.S. react or overreact to this,” said Jarrett Blanc, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation.
Iran is believed to have the region’s largest stockpile of short-range ballistic missiles, and a large number of American military and diplomatic facilities in the region were seen as potential targets for reprisals. Another option is Iranian proxies.
“As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the region,” according to a Pentagon statement.
The U.S. had vowed a quick and overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks and over the past week deployed about 3,500 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne to Kuwait and three Navy ships with about 2,200 Marines to the Persian Gulf region.
Drone Strike
Tensions between the U.S. and Iran soared following a Dec. 27 rocket assault on an Iraqi base that killed an American contractor. The U.S. blamed Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia closely associated with Iran.
On Dec. 29, U.S. aircraft struck five bases in Iraq and Syria used by Kataib Hezbollah. Two days later, dozens of Iraqi militiamen and their supporters stormed the U.S. embassy complex in Baghdad. The U.S. responded with the drone strike on Soleimani."
conservative,"Red Flags Emerge With Record-High Stocks Brushing Aside Political Turmoil
President Donald Trump toned down rhetoric against Iran, fueling a rally in American stocks that took major benchmarks to fresh records.
The rebound from an overnight rout that topped 1.5% has some investors breathing a sigh of relief, but another cohort point to mounting signs that the comeback is a sign of complacency among bulls.
“This is a market looking through fundamental data, looking through corporate guidance and data points, looking through Fed guidance itself,” Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told Bloomberg Television. “It is a market that wants to go up in the short term. That is what makes it so profoundly dangerous.”
Who Needs Hedging?
As the world awaited Iran’s response to Friday’s U.S. killing of a top general, equity traders showed little inclination to hedge against losses. The cost of a bearish put option versus that of a call continued to slide, recently touching levels that have been rare throughout the bull market, Cboe data show.
Breadth Surge
The latest surge has taken 82% of S&P 500 firms above their average price for the past 200 days, the highest percentage in two years. Such strong market breadth, where gains are not concentrated in a few heavyweights, is generally a sign that a rally has room to run. But Frank Cappelleri, a senior equity trader and market technician at Instinet in New York, says the current reading is a “frothy indicator we need to watch.”
According to Cappelleri, the last time so many firms topped the key level, the benchmark fell into a correction not long after. “Eventually, many stocks will slip back below their long-term moving averages -- like they always do,” Cappelleri wrote to clients Wednesday.
Shorts Evaporate
After last year’s historic run, investors continue to expect further gains. Short sales in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, known by its ticker SPY, as a percentage of shares outstanding fell to 1.1% Tuesday, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s the lowest level since January 2018, before the event known as “Volmageddon” sent stocks swooning.
Leveraged Love
Exchange-traded fund investors are going all in, rushing for some of the riskiest products out there that bet stocks will keep on rising. Jason Goepfert, the president of Sundial Capital Research, tracks assets in popular leveraged long products (ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF and ProShares Ultra QQQ, for example) compared to their counterparts that bet on a decline. Over the past month, assets in leveraged long ETFs have gained more than 15%, while the short products have lost more than 10%, his data show.
“This is another concern for stocks here, as leveraged traders have become far too comfortable,” Goepfert wrote to clients.
Technical Signs
One particular technical indicator is now flashing “sell.” The GTI Vera Convergence Divergence Indicator, which measures momentum shifts upwards and downwards, received a new bearish signal late last week, and warning continues to flash."
conservative,"NHTSA Probing Fatal Crash of Tesla and Fire Truck in Indiana
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will probe the Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Tesla Inc. vehicle that slammed into a parked fire truck on an Indiana highway, the agency said on Wednesday evening.
The fire truck had its emergency lights flashing while responding to an earlier crash and was parked across a left-hand lane on Interstate 70 roughly 45 miles west of Indianapolis when it was hit by the Tesla, the Indiana State Police said in a Dec. 29 statement.
The 23-year-old wife of the Tesla’s driver died of her injuries at a hospital, according to the statement. The 25-year-old driver was injured. No firefighters were hurt. 
The state police said they planned to reconstruct the crash, which occurred about 8 a.m., as part of their investigation, and that drugs and alcohol were not contributing factors.
NHTSA did not specify whether Tesla’s collection of automated driver-assist technologies known as Autopilot were active in the Indiana crash, but the investigation follows a series of inquiries opened into such crashes.
NHTSA has looked into 23 crashes in which some form of automated driver-assist technologies were believed to be in use at the time of the collisions. Of those, 14 of involved Tesla models, NHTSA said in its statement."
conservative,"TikTok Security Flaws May Have Exposed User Videos to Hackers
A cybersecurity firm has called attention to security holes in TikTok that would have allowed hackers to infiltrate the accounts among its billion-plus users, another black eye for a Chinese-owned social media phenom that’s drawn fire from U.S. lawmakers.
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. outlined in a report a series of vulnerabilities that cyber-attackers could exploit to manipulate user accounts and information, from revealing personal data and deleting videos to sending text messages on behalf of TikTok. The research firm said it informed TikTok -- owned by Chinese giant ByteDance Inc. -- which deployed fixes. TikTok confirmed the patches and said it was committed to protecting user data, and encouraged researchers to privately disclose flaws.
The revelations may intensify the scrutiny over a social media service that’s exploded in popularity globally in past years. ByteDance has emerged as the world’s most valuable startup thanks largely to the platform, where more than a billion, largely young, users share lip-syncing and dance videos. But with escalating tensions between China and the U.S., American politicians have warned the app represents a national security threat and urged an investigation. The Beijing-based company is weighing options to address those concerns.
“TikTok videos are entertaining. They’ve created a major trend, a style, even a musical genre,” Check Point researchers wrote in the report. “But as some have experienced, there is often a fine line between fun clips to private, even intimate assets being compromised while trusting to be under the protection from the apps we use.”"
conservative,"Voters Fail Mock Election, Exposing Vulnerability to Hackers
There’s a secret weapon in America’s battle to secure the 2020 vote from nation-state hackers: the voters. But there’s a problem. Only a few of them are in on the secret.
Many voters across the country will cast ballots this year on machines called ballot-marking devices, which attempt to marry the convenience of touchscreen technology with an auditable paper trail. To ensure that these BMDs accurately translate each voter’s choices from screen to paper, voters must verify summary receipts or ballot cards to identify errors, if they exist.
Yet only 6.6% of voters in a mock Michigan election discovered mistakes -- like a vote for a candidate they hadn’t selected -- that were deliberately introduced into the machines to mimic the work of a hacker. Only 40% of participants bothered to check the ballots without being prompted, according to a report published Wednesday by the University of Michigan called “Can Voters Detect Malicious Manipulation of Ballot Marking Devices.”
States and local jurisdictions across the country are embracing these voting machines, which proponents say provide a paper trail that catches computer errors -- or hacks -- before a winner is declared. South Carolina and Georgia -- accounting for about 9 million voters -- have adopted BMDs. So have several counties in Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles County, the largest election jurisdiction in the U.S.
The Michigan study determined that these largely unproven machines carry risks and vulnerabilities capable of undermining the integrity of elections in 2020. If any are infected with malware, the paper trail designed to verify results could be corrupted, allowing cheating in the election to go undetected, according to the report.
The study asked 241 eligible voters to cast ballots at a pair of Ann Arbor libraries on three BMDs over three days in July and September. Voters were told they were participating in a study to assess the “usability of a new type of voting machine,” according to the report.
The voters made their selections on the screens and printed their ballots before walking over to a scanner a few feet away. What they didn’t know was that their ballots included at least one intentional error and that surveyors were watching to see how many voters would check their ballots before formally submitting them.
When unprompted, more than 93% of voters didn’t catch a mistake despite checking the ballot, apparently putting their faith in the computer to protect their vote. In at least one case, voters who found mistakes blamed themselves instead of the machine.
“I don’t remember voting for the member of Congress and there was a vote” on the paper ballot, said one voter, according to the report. “I may have but just don’t remember.”
The study tried multiple techniques to remind voters, including signs in the polling place and verbal cues. The findings improved when poll workers prompted voters to check their ballots. For instance, every voter reviewed their ballot once informed that the paper records were the “official record” of their vote. But even then, only 38.5% of voters found the mistakes in their ballots, too low a rate to alert precinct workers of a system-wide problem requiring intervention, according to the report.
The report acknowledges that BMDs do have benefits. They are better than having no paper trail and assist voters with disabilities. But they also require further evaluation before being used as the primary method of voting, as will be the case in jurisdictions across the country in 2020, said J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan.
“Technology in voting is very popular; only a small number of voters understand the risk of hacking,” said Halderman, an author of the report. “I don’t think we’re too flawed as a species to execute democracy, but we need to use the tools that are available to us that ensure the credibility of our results. BMDs have not been proved to be safe and effective.”"
conservative,"Netflix Snubbed at Golden Globes as Gervais Skewers Hollywood
“1917,” a World War I epic from director Sam Mendes and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures, won the prize for best drama Sunday from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, inserting itself into an awards race just days ahead of its wide release in theaters. Mendes also took home the prize for best director.
That was bad news for Netflix Inc. “1917” beat out four other pictures, including three contenders from the streaming giant: “The Irishman,” “Marriage Story” and “The Two Popes.” Pundits had seen “The Irishman” as the frontrunner -- not just Sunday night but at the Academy Awards next month. But Netflix won just two prizes on the night, one for its TV show “The Crown” and another for “Marriage Story.”
The result is a scrambled race for the best-picture Oscar -- Hollywood’s most-coveted prize -- as nine different movies won awards out of the 14 Golden Globe categories, and no movie won more than three. Netflix fell as much as 1.4% in New York trading Monday.
If any film emerged as a frontrunner for the Oscars, it is Quentin Tarantino and Sony Corp.’s “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood,” which won the Golden Globe for best film comedy. Tarantino also won best screenplay for his ode to 1960s Hollywood, while Brad Pitt won best supporting actor for his performance as a stunt double to the film’s lead actor, Leonardo DiCaprio.
“Thank you to the eclectic and ever raucous Hollywood Foreign Press Association,” Pitt said in accepting his award.
The NBC telecast was hosted by comic actor Ricky Gervais, fronting the show for the fifth time. In his opening monologue, he skewered actors who use their acceptance speeches for political statements -- and the companies they work for.
“Well, you say you’re woke, but the companies you work for in China -- unbelievable. Apple, Amazon, Disney. If ISIS started a streaming service you’d call your agent, wouldn’t you?”
The commentary struck a nerve on social media, with the hashtag #HollywoodHypocrites trending on Twitter Monday. But picking Gervais as host didn’t boost the ratings. NBC said on Monday the show was seen by 18.3 million viewers, down about 1.7% from a year earlier.
Foreign Journalists
While the Oscars reflect the tastes of the people who work in Hollywood, the Globes are decided by a few dozen international journalists. They have always shown a preference for big names, leading to surprise winners.“1917,” which opened in select theaters in December, will go into wide release Friday.
Winners in the big Golden Globe categories, best drama and best musical or comedy, have gone on to win best-picture Oscars five times over the past decade. Double winners include “Green Book,” “Moonlight,” and “Argo.”
And while the Golden Globes have never been the best predictor of Oscar glory, the top awards can extend a movie’s life at the box office, and a growing cadre of streaming services view them as a key way to bring in subscribers and attract talent for projects.
Netflix has chased awards with particular gusto, spending tens of millions of dollars on campaigns and angering competitors. Awards voters were at first reluctant to acknowledge Netflix, which has upended Hollywood’s economics.
Major theater chains refuse to show Netflix movies -- because they become available for streaming so soon -- and some major media companies have stopped selling their TV shows and films to the streaming giant.
Filmmaker Resistance
But resistance from filmmakers melted in the face of funding for their projects. A veritable who’s who of filmmakers, including Alfonso Cuaron, Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Ava DuVernay, has now made films for the company. The imprimatur of those lions of cinema has helped Netflix charm awards voters. The company received more Globes nominations than any other studio, and Cuaron won the Oscar for best director last year.
“No one cares about cinema and no one watches network TV,” Gervais said in his opening monologue. “Everyone’s watching Netflix.”
Everyone, that is, except members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Netflix’s lavish spending and plethora of nominees didn’t result in many victories.
Korean Victory
“Parasite” won the Golden Globe for best foreign-language film, the first South Korean movie to ever win that prize in the event’s 77-year history. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, “Parasite” is a parable of class, family and privilege about a poor Korean family that insinuates itself into the lives of a wealthy family.
‘Parasite’ Is Awarded Top Foreign Film at Golden Globes
The film debuted in October to ecstatic reviews and was named the year’s best film by the National Society of Film Critics.
The win boosts the Oscar odds of “Parasite,” which has the third-best shot at winning best picture according to Gold Derby. Winning the top prize is always a challenge for a foreign film, and foreign movies can’t even be nominated for the best drama or comedy at the globes.
Unlike the Emmys and the Oscars, the Golden Globes honor both films and TV shows. HBO’s “Succession” was crowned best drama while Amazon.com Inc.’s “Fleabag” won best comedy.
AT&T Inc.’s HBO won the most awards of any network, scoring four between “Succession,” a drama about a family that controls a media empire, and “Chernobyl,” a miniseries about the disaster at a nuclear plant in the old Soviet Union.
Despite earning the most nominations of any network, Netflix only won one prize for TV shows. Apple Inc., a newcomer to the awards circuit, failed to win a statue in its first year competing at the Golden Globes.
The iPhone maker earned three nominations for “The Morning Show,” its drama set behind the scenes of a TV news program upended when one of the hosts is accused of sexual harassment.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook attended the program, and was almost immediately subjected to a barb from Gervais, who last hosted the show in 2016.
“Apple roared into the TV game with ‘The Morning Show,’ a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China,” he quipped.
Facebook Inc. also took a shot, from comic actor Sacha Baron Cohen, who was introducing the film “Jojo Rabbit,” a satire about a young German boy who finds out his mother his hiding a Jewish girl in the attic.
“The hero of this next movie is a naive, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends,” he said. “His name is Mark Zuckerberg. Sorry, this is an old intro for ‘Social Network.’”"
conservative,"JPMorgan Boosts Annual Fee on Chase Sapphire Reserve Card
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is boosting the annual fee for customers to $550 from $450 as it adds new perks with partners such as DoorDash and Lyft Inc., according to bank spokeswoman Ashley Dodd. For new cardholders, the increased annual fee will go into effect on Jan. 12, while existing customers will pay the new fee once their cards renew starting April 1.
The increase follows a move by rival American Express Co. in 2017, when the company raised the fee on its Platinum card to $550 after adding benefits like a $200 annual Uber credit to its bevy of benefits. The two firms have been battling for premium millennial customers since 2016, when JPMorgan debuted the Sapphire Reserve.
JPMorgan said Tuesday that it’s adding the perk of a year of lower DoorDash fees, and on Wednesday said it’ll give Sapphire Reserve customers $120 in statement credits for the food-delivery service. The bank also will partner with Lyft to offer Sapphire Reserve members a free year of Lyft Pink, a new monthly membership program from the ride-sharing app, as well as 10 points per dollar spent with the company, Dodd said.
The bank is trying to lure new customers by targeting services that are surging in popularity. JPMorgan said customers more than doubled their spending on food-delivery services in the past year, with the average person ordering in a least once a month. Most Sapphire Reserve customers use ride-hailing apps at least once a week, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing internal data.
Since JPMorgan introduced the luxury card, industry watchers have wondered how the bank could make money on it while still offering generous benefits like three points per dollar spent on dining and travel, which can be redeemed for more than one cent per point. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. estimated in 2016 that the bank wouldn’t break even on its investment in the card for more than five years.
Many of the world’s biggest card issuers have been scaling back perks and introductory offers in recent months as the industry begins to prepare for an eventual downturn in consumer credit. Last year, Citigroup Inc. discontinued free trip insurance and price-protection guarantees on its U.S. cards, and AmEx’s chief executive officer said last month that the war for premium consumers has begun to level off."
conservative,"Despite Trump’s Claim, the U.S. Still Needs Some Middle East Oil
President Donald Trump said during an address from the White House Wednesday that the U.S. no longer needs oil from the Middle East, but American refineries still use the kind of oil that region produces.
Thanks to booming shale production, the U.S. reduced shipments from the Persian Gulf to a 30-year low last year. Still, Middle East crude makes up more than 10% of U.S. imports. With new oil production records being set in the Permian Basin, the country’s energy growth engine, America’s thinning reliance on Middle East crude isn’t about to reverse course.
Before the “shale revolution,” as American drillers call it, Gulf coast refiners invested millions of dollars to process relatively cheap heavy oil from the Middle East and Latin America. At the same time, shale oil is much lighter and lower in sulfur compared with supply from the Persian Gulf, and not ideal for most American refineries.
Sources of heavy crude supplies have already been limited since the U.S. levied sanctions on Venezuelan oil, declining Mexican production and Canadian logistical constraints. With sanctions already on Iran, buyers are still dependent on other Persian Gulf producers."
conservative,"Iran Won’t Be Satisfied by Iraq Missile Attacks
There’s a temptation to characterize the Iranian missile attacks on an Iraqi base on Tuesday night as a letting off of steam by the Islamic Republic — a shot across the American bow, after which the two sides can begin to parley. It’s being suggested that, if President Donald Trump restrains himself from tit-for-tat action, the tensions raised by the killing of Qassem Soleimani might begin to ease.
Color me skeptical. The regime in Tehran, having whipped itself into a hysteria over the assassination, is unlikely to satisfy itself with a mere volley of missiles; and the fact that no Americans were killed will do little to slake Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s bloodlust. 
More likely, the missiles mark the first salvo of what Khamenei has promised will be “severe retaliation” against the U.S. for taking out his favorite killing machine. Having encouraged millions of Iranians to come out into the streets to mourn Soleimani and demand vengeance, the Supreme Leader has painted himself into a corner. His description of last night’s strikes as “a slap in the face” of the U.S. will not fool his countrymen, and certainly not the families of the 56 killed in the stampede at Soleimani’s funeral.
Nor will it suffice for Iran’s proxy militias in Iraq, which have lost several leaders to American attacks in recent days, including Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces.
The most noteworthy aspect to the missile strikes is that they were unambiguously of Iranian provenance; unlike, say, the attacks on Saudi oil installations last September, there was no effort to obfuscate the origins of the missiles, nor to pretend they were shot off by proxy militias acting on their own initiative. Khamenei had already signaled that he wanted the response to Soleimani’s death to bear an Iranian signature, and he has been as good as his word.  
This doesn’t mean the next salvos will come from Iranian soil. Although Iranian militias were clearly under instruction to hold their fire while Tehran took the first shot, they’ve been itching to demonstrate their own fealty to Soleimani, and will now feel freer to act. This is especially true of the militias farther from the range of American counter-strikes: Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas in Gaza.
Nor has Khamenei forsworn the Islamic Republic’s traditional tactics: unclaimed attacks on international shipping; rocket strikes on U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia; the kidnapping of Westerners; cyber-warfare; and assassinations in Europe. The chances that Iran will use any of these measures is unchanged.
Some early reports suggest that the absence of casualties from last night’s barrage was no accident — that the Iranians warned the Iraqis of the incoming missiles, and the latter in turn warned the Americans. But this was, more than likely, a courtesy extended to what Tehran regards as a friendly government in Baghdad. If the next strikes on U.S. nationals or interests occur in countries hostile to Iran, such warnings may not be forthcoming.
Nor is it safe to assume that Trump will leave the Iranian attack unanswered. He tweeted that “all is well” after the missile strikes, but that was a reference to the absence of American casualties, and shouldn’t be read as a signal that he’s prepared to wind down hostilities. In ordering the killing of Soleimani, Trump indicated that he is willing to punish Iran directly, and disproportionately, for the actions of its proxies, so any attacks against Americans by an Iraqi militia could lead to blowback against Iranian targets.
Separately, the U.S. may not have ended its campaign of decapitating the leadership of Iranian proxies. Even if these kill no more high-value Iranians, Khamenei may feel obliged to respond.
Another interesting feature of Tuesday night’s missile barrage is that the Iranians showed not even a pretense of concern for Iraqi sovereignty. It suggests the Islamic Republic will no longer hold to its practice of using Arab proxies to kill Arabs, a risky change of tactics at a time when many Iraqis, Lebanese and other Arabs are already outraged by Iranian meddling in their countries.
Khamenei may be calculating that the Iraqi government will make no more than a token protest at the attacks. It’s a safe bet that the large contingent of Iraqi politicians beholden to Tehran won’t be as offended by Iranian military action on their soil as they professed to be by Soleimani’s killing.
But the Iraqi civilians whose recent protests have been overshadowed by the events of the past week will be outraged by Tehran’s temerity — especially if it emerges that some of their fellow citizens were killed or hurt by the missile attacks. Their protests will grow more determined, and Khamenei will respond the only way he knows how: brute force.
Rather than putting a lid on tensions in Iraq and the Middle East, Iran’s missile attacks will almost certainly turn the dial up a notch."
conservative,"Iran’s Retaliation Is More Conventional Than Expected
After a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last week, America braced itself for the unexpected: The Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory warning that Iran may launch cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. New York’s governor deployed the National Guard to New York City’s major airports.
Those precautions are wise and understandable. But Iran’s missile attacks on bases hosting U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday shows that the regime’s retaliation may be more conventional than expected.
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has used terrorist groups as proxies to strike at civilians and embassies, attempting to obscure its own responsibility for these attacks. Now the Iranian regime is signaling a new approach. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told his advisers last week that its response should be a “direct and proportional attack on American interests,” according to the New York Times, and that it should be “openly carried out by Iranian forces themselves.” 
That said, there is good reason to doubt that Iran’s response will be limited to this attack. Iran has fought its wars through proxies since the 1990s. This was Soleimani’s legacy. From 2003 until his death last week, he built up militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, waging an imperial war in the shadows on Iran’s behalf throughout the Middle East.
Some analysts acknowledge that Iran’s military has the capability to do a lot of damage, particularly to U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But it “is not going to be able to out-escalate the United States,” says Alireza Nader, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Khamenei understands this, he says, and he may be attempting to convey strength at a moment when the regime has been weakened.
Another possibility is that the U.S. drone strike demolished the strategy of plausible deniability that Iran has relied on for so long. It’s not just that Iran’s generals could no longer count on being spared the fate of the terrorists they cultivated and sponsored. The strike signaled a new U.S. strategy that imposes grave costs for Iran’s broader proxy war.
The regime will almost certainly still depend on its terrorist proxies. But Iran’s missile strike shows that it is prepared to engage in direct military attacks to take revenge for Soleimani. The world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism will also rely on conventional warfare."
conservative,"Trump’s Thin Crisis Team Is Scary, Too
I’ll leave the analysis of the foreign policy and military actions between Iran and the U.S. to the experts. For what it’s worth, my read of the experts after Iran attacked U.S. military bases in Iraq Tuesday night was fairly optimistic; many sense that there’s an opportunity here for President Donald Trump to de-escalate and avoid full-out war. 
What I do know something about is the process of presidential policy formation and implementation. And that leaves me as pessimistic as ever. The U.S. enters this crisis with a woefully thin and inexperienced team.
Trump himself, of course, is no expert. That’s not unusual. Of the postwar presidents, only Dwight Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and perhaps Richard Nixon entered the White House with serious foreign policy and national security credentials. There does seem to be some correlation with success there; Ike, Bush and perhaps Nixon were all quite good at that part of the job. But others have been fine despite coming into the job without a lot of relevant experience. Still, Trump is unusually lacking in relevant experience, and there’s little sign that he’s getting better as he goes along. 
That’s partly because the executive branch and the White House are, among other things, a giant information machine, able to supply a skilled president with expertise on any subject imaginable — not just a single answer, but multiple sources giving expertise from multiple perspectives, all double-checked by White House staffers who are free from the bureaucratic biases that executive branch departments and agencies breed. 
Except when the administration is badly understaffed, as this one has been from Day One. Political scientist Elizabeth Saunders tweeted on Tuesday:
Things that any administration would want right now: a robust communications operation across the US government, including/especially the White House; a full staffed diplomatic corps and civilian shop in the Pentagon; strong relationships with allies.
This administration doesn’t have those things. In fact, as the historian and journalist Garrett Graff pointed out:
Reminder that as this crisis escalates, we have no Director of National Intelligence, no Dep Dir, no Homeland Security Scretary, no Dep Sec, no head of CBP or ICE, no State Dept Under Sec of Arms Control, no Asst Sec for Europe, and no Navy Sec.
Yes, there are acting officials in all of those positions and so many more, but Matt Glassman is correct: “Acting officials are weak. They’re the substitute teachers of political leadership.” That means they’re less likely to stand up to the president and give him information that he needs, and they’re also less likely to be good at soliciting information from their agencies. 

The truth is that the positions that are in place aren’t exactly filled with all-stars, either. That’s what happens when the presidency — not quite three years old yet — is already on its fourth national security adviser, second secretaries of defense and state, third White House chief of staff, and on and on. Record turnover in the White House and the cabinet is like instability in any organization; people don’t really get to know their job properly, or develop good working relationships with others in their own agencies or their counterparts across the government. 

Now, there’s no straight line between these problems and any particular outcome. And the two biggest foreign policy fiascoes since World War II — Vietnam and the Iraq War — were both the products of what were at the time extremely well regarded national security and foreign policy teams. But it almost certainly is true that inexperienced, unqualified and unconfirmed people in key positions increases the chances of things going wrong. 
1. Michael C. Horowitz and Elizabeth N. Saunders at the Monkey Cage on why all-out war between Iran and the U.S. is unlikely.
2. Nathaniel Rakich puts Trump’s approval ratings at the beginning of the election year in historical perspective.
3. Greg Sargent on the increasingly implausible arguments Republican senators are making against impeachment trial witnesses and other evidence.
4. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Feldman on John Bolton. Key point: “If Bolton really wanted to tell his story, nothing stops him from holding a press conference and doing so.” Exactly. And I’d add that Bolton has an ethical obligation to tell that story, whether it helps or hurts Trump.
5. And Ian Richardson on the expected record turnout for the Iowa caucuses. "
conservative,"Trump’s Iran Speech Had Three Audiences

President Donald Trump’s speech on Iran will not go down in memory as eloquent or inspiring — but it gave the world what it needed most today: an opportunity for de-escalation. The U.S. president was unquestionably speaking to many audiences, and most should be more pleased than upset by what they heard.
For Americans, and the president’s supporters in particular, they heard a leader who remains resolute on Iran and unyielding in his objectives to have Iran end its nuclear weapons ambitions and its use of terrorism to destabilize the region and threaten American interests.
For Iranians, although Trump hardly offered an olive branch, the absence of threats of military force should be the key takeaway; it may be the first time the announcement of more sanctions would be welcome in Tehran. Moreover, in several parts of the speech, Trump referenced a desire to see a peaceful and prosperous Iran — without any obvious suggestion of regime change being the prerequisite.
Europeans may see the speech in mixed terms. They are likely to bristle at the president’s call for the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to abandon the nuclear deal. And they will be quite surprised by Trump’s announcement that he will ask NATO to do more in the Middle East — particularly after the United States gave its European allies no warning about the strike on Soleimani, which sharply changed the threat environment for the hundreds of British, German, Dutch, and others serving there.
But Europeans should look beyond those two major points. First, the call to abandon the Iran nuclear deal is not as dramatic as it sounds. Given America’s withdrawal and Iran’s latest violations, it is hard to imagine that deal could be revived without a significant renegotiation of it. Instead, the more noteworthy sentences are the ones that came next: “We must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.” Europeans could and should take this as an invitation to do exactly what seven former European ministerial level officials called for in a statement on Jan. 8: to “urgently position European states as active mediators to de-escalate the situation.”
Second, the request to NATO should not be rejected out of hand. In fact, it may be the most useful suggestion contained in the speech overall. The actions of the last week have precipitated a real crisis between the United States and Iraq — one in which the Iraqi parliament has passed a non-binding resolution calling for the eviction of all foreign forces in Iraq, including the 5,200 American soldiers currently operating there. It is not at all clear that this momentum can be completely reversed. However, incorporating more Americans into the existing NATO training mission in Iraq could be a way to meet intense Iraqi political pressure for change in the status quo without removing all Americans from Iraqi soil.
Iraqis are likely to be the most disappointed of all the constituencies watching President Trump’s speech today. The president lost an opportunity this morning to calm the spike in U.S.-Iraq tensions that have followed the Soleimani killing. Beyond being thankful that no Iraqi lives were lost in the Iranian attacks on U.S. bases last night, the president did not even mention Iraq. He could have instead communicated a series of important messages that may have allowed Baghdad and Washington to launch a slow, deliberative and analytical process to re-evaluate their relationship — rather than the emotional Iraqi calls for eviction and the emotional calls of the president for sanctions on Iraq.

There is still time to make the comments Iraqis want and need to hear. And a further, more practical gesture could also reinforce the de-escalatory intention behind the speech: approving the visa sought (and apparently denied) by Iranian Foreign Minister Javid Zarif to attend UN Security Council meetings in New York this week.
It will take more to dampen the crisis that has gripped the world for the last week. But there are enough positives in the president’s speech to build upon."
conservative,"Trump Doesn’t Want War With Iran
It’s too soon to say whether Iran’s retaliation for the killing of its most important general will be limited to this week’s missile salvo at two U.S.-Iraqi bases in Iraq. As my colleague Bobby Ghosh writes, “The fact that no Americans were killed will do little to slake Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s bloodlust.”  
What is clear, though, is that President Donald Trump is not seeking to invade Iran. To start, he put a positive spin on Iran’s retaliation, saying in a speech Wednesday that the regime “appears to be standing down.” If Trump were really the warmonger that his opponents claim, he would not have described the Iranian attack as a de-escalation.
More to the point, as president Trump has demonstrated that he is uninterested in the lofty goals of nation-building and regime change that once characterized his party. He threatened North Korea with “fire and fury” only to enter negotiations with its tyrant a few months later. He recognized the head of Venezuela’s legislature as the country’s interim president, but has yet to send U.S. forces into Venezuela to oust its dictator.
With Iran, Trump boasted of his decision to end the life of Qassem Soleimani and then threatened to bomb 52 Iranian sites, including cultural ones. On Wednesday, he vowed that Iran would not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon “as long as I am president.”
And yet in that same speech, Trump extended a hand of cooperation to Iran. “The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran,” he said. “We should work together on this and other shared priorities.” This doesn’t sound like a man bent on regime change by military force. They are the words of a president who seeks to deter Iran from targeting Americans and building nuclear weapons. 
Trump’s strategy so far has flummoxed most of his opposition. This week House Democrats will vote on a war powers resolution aimed at limiting the president’s authority to attack Iran. This move would make sense if it were 2002, George W. Bush were president, and an invasion force of more than 100,000 troops were being positioned in the Middle East.
But Trump won his party’s nomination partly by sounding like an anti-war activist, with his attacks on Bush’s legacy in Iraq and accusations that he lied the country into war. Just as defeated generals are often accused of fighting the last war, Democrats are now legislating against the last war.
A more sophisticated argument against Trump’s policy is that the killing of Soleimani was so escalatory that it invites the kind of Iranian retaliation that will make a hot war inevitable. That is indeed a real risk. But if this is the case, Democrats should be bolstering America’s deterrence against Iran, not undermining it.
Instead of offering a resolution to limit Trump’s range of responses to the next Iranian attack, Democrats should warn Iran that it will face more misery if its leaders choose to escalate. It’s not a stance likely to win support from the party’s online activists, many of whom are warning of a repeat of the Iraq war. It is, however, a position that would demonstrate seriousness at a moment of high partisan folly from all sides.
It may also help dissuade Iranian officials from rashly seeking vengeance for Soleimani’s death. It’s sometimes said that war is the failure of diplomacy. That’s not quite right. More often, war is the failure of deterrence."
conservative,"Gun Control is not a policy. It’s a slogan. Each time there’s a mass shooting, Democrats and members of the media (but I repeat myself) rush to the microphones and cameras to declare that this, finally, is the proper time to push Gun Control. Gun Control, in this case, is defined as literally anything that restricts gun purchases, transfers, or ownership. It is virtually never anything that will do anything to stop mass shootings. The argument goes something like this. Other countries do not experience anything remotely approaching the level of mass shootings we have in the United States. Those countries have heavy gun regulations. Therefore, if we impose gun regulations in the United States, the level of mass shootings will drop. The fallacy in this argument is that the United States has a unique philosophy, history, population, and ownership level of firearms already. That means that proposed solutions must take into account those varying factors, and deal with them head-on. But Gun Control advocates refuse to do so. Instead, they merely shout “GUN CONTROL,” and then defy their opponents to speak out against the slogan. They proclaim that the vast majority of Americans want more Gun Control. But that’s as empty as stating that the vast majority of Americans want government spending cuts. It’s not that the devil is in the details. It’s that the details are the entire matter under discussion. The question with regard to spending is: which programs would you cut? And the question with Gun Control is: which people would you prevent from getting guns, and how? The Left rarely proposes an actual piece of legislation. That’s deliberate. First off, many conservatives are in favor of certain gun control proposals — even the NRA backs certain gun control proposals, particularly with regard to fully automatic machine guns and prevention of mentally ill people from obtaining weapons. If the Left were to propose a piece of legislation, they’d have to defend it on the merits. They wouldn’t be able to posture about how “everyone but those evil Second Amendment advocates agrees!” Because not everyone would agree with their proposals. In fact, most people typically haven’t. Which is why Democrats, enjoying a 60-vote majority in the Senate and a wide majority in the House from 2009-2011, passed precisely zero major pieces of gun legislation — and why when Barack Obama attempted to use the Social Security Administration to seize guns from elderly people who used a proxy for their finances, even the ACLU opposed him. All of which means that Democratic addiction to talking about Gun Control is precisely that: addiction to talking about Gun Control. It’s not an addiction to recommending anything, let alone doing anything. It makes people on the Left feel good to spout this sort of nonsense. But it doesn’t forward the debate. It’s not designed to do so. In fact, it’s designed to inhibit conversation and prevent change."
conservative,"In the past several weeks, a bevy of states have passed extensive new restrictions on abortion. Alabama has effectively banned abortion from point of conception. Georgia has banned abortion from the time a heartbeat is detected, as have Ohio, Kentucky and Mississippi. Missouri has banned abortion after eight weeks. Other states are on the move as well. This has prompted paroxysms of rage from the media and the political left — the same folks who celebrated when New York passed a law effectively allowing abortion up until point of birth and who defended Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's perverse statements about late-term abortion. According to these thinkers, conservatives have encroached on a supposed ""right to abortion"" inherent in the Constitution. This, of course, is a lie. There is no ""right to abortion"" in the Constitution. The founders would have been appalled by such a statement. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade (1973) is a legal monstrosity by every available metric: As legal scholar John Hart Ely wrote, Roe ""is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be."" The court's rationale is specious; the court relied on the ridiculous precedent in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) that a broad ""right to privacy"" can be crafted from ""penumbras, formed by emanations."" Then the court extended that right to privacy to include the killing of a third party, an unborn human life — and overrode state definitions of human life in the process. How? The court relied on the self-contradictory notion of ""substantive due process"" — the belief that a law can be ruled unconstitutional under the Fifth and 14th amendments so long as the court doesn't like the substance of the law. That's asinine, obviously. The due process provision of both amendments was designed to ensure that state and federal government could not remove life, liberty or property without a sufficient legal process, not to broadly allow courts to strike down state definitions of conduct that justify removal of life, liberty and property. As Justice Clarence Thomas has written, ""The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause is not a 'secret repository of substantive guarantees against ""unfairness.""'"" Nonetheless, the notion that such a right to abortion is enshrined in America's moral fabric has taken hold among the intelligentsia. Thus, we now experience the odd spectacle of those on the political left declaring that the Constitution enshrines a right to abortion — yet does not include a right to bear arms, a right to freedom of political speech, a right to retain property free of government seizure or a right to practice religion. For much of the left, then, the term ""constitutional right"" has simply come to mean ""thing I want."" And that is incredibly dangerous, given that the power of the judiciary springs not from legislative capacity but from supposed interpretive power. Judges are not supposed to read things into the Constitution but to properly read the Constitution itself. The use of the judiciary as a club has led to a feeling of radical frustration among Americans; it has radically exacerbated our culture gap. The legislative moves in Alabama and other states will open a much-needed debate about the role of the states, the role of legislatures and the role of government. All of that is good for the country. Those who insist, however, that the Supreme Court act as a mechanism for their political priorities are of far more danger to the country than that debate."
conservative,"The revelation that Canadian prime minister and international leftist darling Justin Trudeau wore blackface on several occasions in the 1990s and early 2000s offers several opportunities for social growth. First, we may enjoy the absurdity of the costumes itself. As cancel culture attempts to abolish comedy, lily-white Justin Trudeau’s photos as an Arabian prince and the King of Calypso give us all a needed laugh. Second, we may savor the schadenfreude as the Left squirms to defend Trudeau’s repeated donning of blackface just one year after demanding Megyn Kelly’s head for merely discussing the propriety of the costume. And third, we might use Trudeau’s minstrel show to turn our society away from cancel culture and toward one marked by grace and civility. No one actually cares about blackface. If they did, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Ted Danson, Joni Mitchell, Billy Crystal, Cyndi Lauper, Fred Armisen, Howard Stern, Robert Downey Jr., and Sarah Silverman, among others, would no longer have careers — much less continue to enjoy widespread popularity. Ralph Northam would no longer serve as governor of Virginia. All people of goodwill object to racial hatred. But no one cares that Billy Crystal darkened his skin to portray Sammy Davis Jr. No one thinks Justin Trudeau hates black people. How could Trudeau have impersonated Harry Belafonte without darkening his skin, which is naturally white as the Canadian snow? How could the Wayans brothers have portrayed white chicks without wearing whiteface? Cynical ideologues defend a double standard. They say that the oppressed may imitate their oppressors, but the oppressors may not imitate the oppressed. So blacks may lighten their skin, but whites may not darken theirs. This rubric leaves much ambiguity. Where, for instance, do Americans of Italian descent fall in the hierarchy of victimhood? In 1891, a group of 11 Italian-Americans became the victims of the largest mass lynching in American history. Who is permitted to dress like a cast member of “Jersey Shore?” Even according to their own premises, the intersectional ideologues contradict themselves. If oppressors may not imitate the oppressed, how can anyone defend wearing drag? If men have oppressed women since time immemorial, as the ideologues insist, then transvestitism is simply blackface for the sexes. Yet the same leftist scolds who harangue their political opponents — and only their political opponents — for wearing blackface not only sanction but even encourage men to dress as women. The Left wields blackface as a political cudgel, feigning offense and making excuses according to political convenience. Conservatives need not embrace the same cynical and vindictive tactics. We would prefer to live in a society marked by grace and civility rather than one marked by petty opportunism and cancel culture. At the same time, we must not unilaterally disarm and let the Left ravage our cutlure without consequence. Fortunately, there is a third way. If prominent leftists in the media and politics — the same hacks who demanded Megyn Kelly’s resignation and leap to accuse their opponents of bigotry at every turn — repent in print and on camera, conservatives ought to let Justin Trudeau’s photos slide. If the Left refuses to admit the error of its ways and accept conservatives’ offer of reason, mercy, and grace, then conservatives must demand Trudeau’s resignation. One way or another, the Left must learn a lesson. Justin Trudeau’s ridiculous costumes have offered us all an opportunity for growth. The Left will likely squander it. Too bad. Either way, conservatives will enjoy the show."
conservative,"Remember that time Seattle’s socialist city council member Kshama Sawant pressed for the city to increase its minimum wage to $15 per hour? I actually debated Sawant on the issue; I asked her if she would be in favor of raising the wage to $1,000 per hour. She misdirected from the issue. Seattle actually ended up embracing $13 per hour, raising the minimum wage from $9.47 in 2014 to $11 in 2015 to $13 in 2016 under the theory that an increase wouldn’t throw people out of work, wouldn’t encourage part-time hiring, and would inflate salaries enough to allow more affordability in the Seattle housing market. A new study demonstrates that, as usual, central planning of the economy leads to precisely the reverse of the results the planners seek to achieve. In other words, restaurants didn’t fire anybody, they just put them on part-time shifts and cut back their hours. That shouldn’t be a surprise, since that’s precisely what happens every time the government places an extra burden on employers. One of the great myths of minimum wage movement — and the central planning movement as a whole — is that business owners aren’t operating at a slim margin, but raking in dollars to hide in their Scrooge McDuck moneybins, depleting the potential income of their employees. But that’s not true. Thanks to competition — and competition is fierce in industries that employ minimum wage workers — profit margins are never enormous. Even in 2013, a booming year for the restaurant business, Capital IQ estimated the average profit margin for restaurants at 2.4%. Profitability varies by chain as well, and by local franchise. Even leftists were taken aback by Seattle’s sizeable minimum wage increase. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a leftist himself, derided the minimum wage increases in Seattle as “beyond moderate” — extreme, in other words. But he admitted, “you [don’t] know what the outcome is going to be. You have to test it, you have to scrutinize it, which is why Seattle is a great test case.” Or you could leave the market alone, since “testing” markets by cramming down interventionism puts people out of work, at least part-time. Here are the facts: Seattle barely had any jobs under the $11 threshold before the legislation passed. But that wasn’t true of $13 jobs. And the regulations essentially priced a good deal of full-time low-wage labor out of the market. Furthermore, the economy in Seattle right now is strong. What happens during a downturn, when businesses have to shed costs? Government intervention isn’t the answer to the free market. The free market is. But don’t expect the Left to admit that they’re not merely punishing “evil” businessmen, they’re skewing the entire labor market and hurting a broad swath of people, including minimum wage employees."
conservative,"Ricky Gervais gave some excellent and useful advice at the end of his brilliant monologue to open the Golden Globes last night. “So if you do win an award tonight, don’t use it as a platform to make a political speech, right?” Gervais said, speaking directly to the assembly of narcissists in front of him. “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So, if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and f*** off. No one cares about your views on politics or culture.” Predictably, none of the assembled narcissists were willing — or perhaps even physically able — to heed this warning. Least of all Michelle Williams, who wasted no time in turning her acceptance speech into a satanic homily. After winning an award for her dazzling role in something or other, Williams pivoted directly to abortion: Her own abortion, to be precise. “I’m grateful for the acknowledgment of the choices I’m made, and I’m also grateful to have lived at a moment in our society where choice exists, because, as women and as girls, things can happen to our bodies that are not our choice,” Williams sermonized. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose, to choose when to have my children and with whom.” We should note that Williams was visibly pregnant while she bragged about killing a previous child. She then ended her speech with a rousing defense of selfishness. “So, women, 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self interest. It’s what men have been doing for years,” she proclaimed, as the camera cut to actresses in the audience literally weeping tears of joy at the very mention of self-interest. Ricky Gervais couldn’t have scripted it any better. Now, first of all, I very much doubt that the people at the awards ceremony last night needed encouragement to act in their own self-interest. I doubt that anyone anywhere in the world needs that sort of encouragement. But if such a person does exist, you won’t find her at the Beverly Hills Hilton. Second, I feel once again compelled to make the obvious point that Michelle Williams and her progressive pals in Hollywood really can’t do this girl power schtick anymore. References to a woman’s body and a woman’s voting habits make absolutely no sense in light of the gender theory that people like Michelle Williams routinely espouse. What the hell is a woman’s body? I mean, I know what it is. But Michelle Williams doesn’t. No member of the American Left does. Yet, when it suits them, they still pretend they do. They obliterate all distinctions between the sexes one minute, and then hope nobody notices when they redraw those distinctions the next minute. Third, Williams packs about a half-dozen non-sequiturs, falsehoods, and delusions into the two sentences she spends talking about her abortion. Let’s take a look at just a few of them. She says that pregnancy is something that can “happen to our bodies that [is] not our choice.” In cases of rape, this is true. But rape accounts for only 1% of all abortions. The other 99% occur because a woman chose to participate in the reproductive act. She chose to do the thing that, by its nature, can, and in billions and billions of cases does, result in the conception of a human life. To say that conception, in these cases, happens against the will of the woman is like saying that my elevated heart rate happens against my will when I use the treadmill. It may be true that I am not specifically willing my heart to beat faster, and it may even be true that I don’t want my heart to beat faster, but I am the one who is making it happen because I am the one who chose to get on the treadmill. Likewise with Williams’ insistence that a woman should be able to choose the person with whom she has children. Every contemporary person on Earth who is not a fundamentalist Islamist agrees. But the word “have” has two pertinent definitions here. Have can mean “to possess, own, or hold,” or it can mean “to experience or undergo.” Another possibly relevant definition is “to be the recipient of.” Whichever definition you choose, it’s clear that you “have” children from the moment they exist as distinct physical entities. That moment occurs when they are conceived, and not when they are born. So you choose who you are going to have children with when you choose who you are going to participate in the reproductive act with. Abortion does not protect that right or, indeed, have anything at all to do with that right. But the most striking and disturbing part of Williams’ abortion apologetic was more subtle. Note that she says “my children.” She claims that abortion enabled her to “choose when to have my children.” Currently, she has two children: One from a previous relationship and the other in the womb (notice how she identifies herself as “having” two children, apparently agreeing that women have children at conception, not birth). When she says that abortion enabled her to “have my children” later on in life, she seems to be almost suggesting that the child she eventually birthed was the same one she aborted years before. Obviously, on an intellectual level, she knows that isn’t the case. But the rhetoric from the abortion lobby and abortion clinics is meant to give this perverse impression. Women are told that they can “put off” being a mother. They can place motherhood on hold for awhile. No need to have a baby now, they’re assured. They can just have it later, when everything is easier and it’s the “right time.” Of course, in reality, motherhood occurs at conception. She is only at the abortion clinic because her attempts to “put off” parenting and babies failed. It is now too late for putting off. It is too late for waiting for a better time. It is too late to “have children” in a more convenient season of life. She is a mother now. That child exists now. If she goes through with the abortion, the child will be killed and he will be dead forever thereafter. And she will not go back to being a woman waiting for the right time. She will now be the mother of a dead child, living in grief or denial. That is the horrible truth. Michelle Williams has three children, not two. One dead and two alive. She has found ways to talk about it and think about it that make her feel a little better about what she’s done. But she knows the truth, deep down. Otherwise she wouldn’t be on that stage, begging for applause."
conservative,"I don’t purport to be a foreign policy expert, but you don’t have to be an expert to know that Iran’s chief terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, was a monstrous, mass murdering scumbag who slaughtered hundreds of Americans, planned attacks on American soil, sowed discord through the region, and coordinated an assault on our embassy in Baghdad. It is good that such a person is now out of the picture. The Earth is a safer place with Soleimani buried beneath it. But Democrats see it differently. In their minds, the problem with Trump killing Soleimani is that Trump is Trump. According to their worldview, nothing Trump does can ever be anything other than apocalyptically awful. And that’s why the Left has lined up to condemn Soleimani’s “assassination” with a hostility and passion that matches the statements being issued from Tehran. While New York Times reporters eulogize the mass murderer by posting clips of him reciting poetry (yes, really), and Hollywood actors condemn Trump as “fascist” as they offer tearful apologies to Iran, elected Democrats have largely refused to find anything positive or praise worthy in the annihilation of a man who killed over 600 American soldiers and was reportedly planning future attacks against Americans. Bernie Sanders blamed Trump for a “dangerous escalation” and warned that his actions will lead to the loss of “countless lives.” Elizabeth Warren also played on the “escalation” theme, describing it as “reckless” for the United States to defend itself against an aggressor. Democrat Senator Chris Murphy was whining a few days ago that Trump has made us look “impotent” and that “no one fears us,” but now he’s concerned that instilling fear in the hearts of terrorist might precipitate a “massive regional war.” Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin underwent a similar sudden conversion. Yesterday afternoon she was accusing the Trump Administration of not “doing anything” about Iran. Later that night, after something had been done, she was worried that Trump didn’t go through the right “inter-agency process” to do it. Revered military analyst Marianne Williamson said that Trump’s strike against Soleimani was “one of most reckless, irresponsible actions ever” by a president. I have no doubt that a President Williamson would solve the Middle East conflict in one fell swoop by wielding her unity crystals. Though one must wonder why she doesn’t use them now, if she has them. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar both expressed outrage at the strike. And both refused to so much as acknowledge Soleimani’s many crimes and provocations. A few responses to all of this. (1) Contrary to outlets like Time and elected officials like Omar and Sanders, this was not an “assassination.” To call it an assassination is to agree with, and disseminate, Iranian government propaganda. An assassination is by definition murder. No American would say that bin Laden or al Baghdadi were murdered, and we shouldn’t say it about Soleimani. He was an aggressor and illegal actor who was killed in a war zone by a lawful strike carried out by the government whose embassy he’d just attacked. (2) If this qualifies as “an act of war,” then Iran had already committed many acts of war against the United States. Attacking our embassy was just the latest, though it alone would seem to warrant this level of response. Are Democrats suggesting that we should not respond to acts of war for fear that the enemy who already hates us and is already attacking us will hate us more and attack us more? Words can scarcely express how cowardly and pathetic that attitude is. (3) Does anyone doubt that almost every Democrat in the country would be extolling the strategic brilliance and moral righteousness of this move if it had been initiated by Obama? After all, there was only a smattering of protest on the Left when Obama sent drones to blow up American citizens. And when he correctly ordered the strike against bin Laden, I don’t recall hearing very many Democrats fretting over reprisals and escalations. Granted, Soleimani is a different beast and this is a different situation. Soleimani was more dangerous, for one. And, yes, he worked directly for a foreign government, as opposed to the fugitive bin Laden hiding out in Pakistan. There are legitimate concerns that can be raised, and anyone who isn’t somewhat worried about where this all might lead must not be paying very close attention. But Democrats are not merely raising concerns or urging caution. They are propagandizing on behalf of the Iranian government. They are refusing to acknowledge that there is any moral justification for, or strategic benefit in, killing the world’s most dangerous terrorist. That’s not because they don’t see the justifications and benefits. It’s because they are totally beholden to their sacred doctrine of Orange Man Bad. And they are willing to say anything, and take any position, for the sake of advancing it."
conservative,"Last week, a member of my Orthodox Jewish congregation approached me at synagogue to tell me a story. Many of the women in the congregation exercise at a females-only gym for modesty purposes. The gym is successful; its main constituency is religious women who don’t wish to be stared at by men, or to see men in various states of undress. According to the congregation member, this month, a transgender woman — a biological male who suffers from gender dysphoria — came to the gym. This man, who retains his male biological characteristics, then entered the locker room and proceeded to disrobe. When told by management that he could use a private dressing room, he refused, announcing that he was a woman and could disrobe in front of all the other women. The predictable result: Many of the actual biological women began cancelling their memberships. When the management asked people higher in the chain, they were simply told that to require the man to use a private dressing room or to reject his membership would subject the company to litigation and possible boycott. So the gym will simply have to lose its chief clientele because a man with a mental disorder believes he has the right to disrobe in front of women. As it turns out, there are indeed public-policy consequences to the question of transgender pronouns. Those public-policy questions all revolve around a central issue: Can subjective perception trump objective observation? If the answer is yes, tyranny of the individual becomes the order of the day. We all must bow before the subjective wants, needs, and desires of people who require special protection from life’s realities. We must reeducate generations of people to ignore science in favor of feelings. We must strong-arm individuals into abandoning central planks of their morality in the name of sensitivity. It’s not just women who wish to avoid indecent exposure. It’s doctors. Take, for example, a New York Times column this week by a transgender woman named Andrea Long Chu. The article, titled “My New Vagina Won’t Make Me Happy,” argues that “sex reassignment surgery” — a gross euphemism, given that sex is not “assigned” in the first place, except by biology — should be available to anyone based simply on want. Chu acknowledges that his new vagina is in fact not a vagina but a “wound” and that “it will require regular, painful attention to maintain.” Chu acknowledges that his dysphoria has “balloon[ed] since I began transition.” Chu admits, “I was not suicidal before hormones. Now I often am.” Still, Chu says, he should be given transgender surgery based simply on want. “Nonmaleficence is a principle violated in its very observation,” Chu states. “Its true purpose is not to shield patients from injury but to install the medical professional as a little king of someone else’s body.” NOW WATCH: 'Trump Signs Executive Order To Fight Anti-Semitism' WATCH: 0:30 Trump Signs Executive Order To Fight Anti-Semitism Meanwhile, Twitter announced this week that it would seek to ban those who “misgender” or “deadname” transgender people. In other words, if you note that Chelsea Manning or Caitlyn Jenner is a man, or if you use the names “Bradley” or “Bruce” with regard to the aforementioned transgender people, Twitter could ban you for “repeated and/or non-consensual slurs.” So you will abide by subjective self-definition, or you will be censored. Twitter recently banned a leftist feminist for merely noting that sex is biological and that men cannot become women. It doesn’t stop there. As Walt Heyer of The Federalist reports, a Texas divorce case now pits a mother who dresses her six-year-old male child, James, as a girl and calls him “Luna” against James’s father, whom she is accusing of child abuse for refusing to treat James as a girl. Heyer reports, “She is also seeking to require him to pay for the child’s visits to a transgender-affirming therapist and transgender medical alterations, which may include hormonal sterilization starting at age eight.” James, it appears, prefers being called James and being treated as a boy by his father (though court documents suggest his parents are litigating this issue against the backdrop of a broader personal dispute). Refusing to abide by the judgment of a six-year-old — or in this case, a six-year-old’s mom — could mean losing your child in a world where we treat sex as malleable. 52 There are real-world consequences to the deliberate rewriting of basic biology, and the substitution of subjectivity for objectivity. It means rewriting business operation, school curricula, medical treatment standards, censorship rules, and even parenting. Sympathy for those who suffer from gender dysphoria is obviously proper — no one wants transgender people harmed or targeted. But sympathy for a mental disorder should not trump either objective reality or competing priorities based on those objective realities. “The Emperor’s New Clothes” is not a story about the wonderful sensitivity of a population educated on the subjective desires of a ruler ensconced in sartorial self-definition. Falsehood crumbles in the light of day, no matter how sympathetic we are to those who wish to perpetuate it — unless force becomes the order of the day."
conservative,"As a fiction writer, I have long felt that leftist philosophy centers on a misunderstanding about narrative. It is an idea widely accepted among the Left that narratives establish reality and that changing the narrative can therefore change reality. If you can monopolize the means of storytelling and silence those who would tell a different story, you can change the truth. Ever after, boys will be girls, all disparities will arise from discrimination, Islam will be the religion of peace, and so on. The Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari has called this manufactured reality “intersubjective” truth — truth created by accepted fictions. Among these intersubjective truths, he includes God, human rights, the value of money, and nationhood. All, he says, have no real existence outside the stories we tell about them. I believe this is a misunderstanding of what fiction actually does. I believe that there are non-material truths that cannot be expressed directly — the presence of God, the natural rights of man, the value of objects in given situations and the shared experience of peoples — and that “fictions” — religion, laws, money, nationhood — express and contain those truths in ways direct language can’t. You can change the fiction but that doesn’t change the underlying truth. Even when every man proclaims there is no God, God will still be there. All you will have managed to do is replace a fiction with a lie. Watching the Democrats this week has been a virtual demonstration in leftist philosophy in action. There they were in plain sight trying to wrench reality into the shape of their narrative. The release of the transcript of a conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proved one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt. It proved that Donald Trump is Donald Trump, garrulous to the point of recklessness in his choice of words. What it didn’t prove, or even convincingly suggest, was that Trump had pressured Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden’s son. This is the accusation that has moved the Democratic Party a foolish step closer to impeachment. Because Nancy Pelosi and the Dems declared what was in the transcript before they saw it, and because the transcript — like the Mueller Report before it — made their assertions look ridiculous, they did what they did with the Mueller report: they rewrote it. The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN all manipulated their reporting on the transcript to make it seem that Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden as a “favor.” In fact, what Trump said was, “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … the server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation.” In other words, he asked for Ukraine to look into Russian/Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. Only later in their convo, after Zelensky brought up the subject of corruption and mentioned an upcoming visit from Rudy Giuliani, did Trump remark on the corruption in Ukraine that might have included Biden’s son Hunter, and suggest that that too should be investigated. But even dishonestly editing the text wasn’t enough for McCarthyite Congressman Adam Schiff — he who repeatedly promised to produce “evidence” of Trump’s collusion with Russia and never did. In questioning acting intelligence chief Joseph Maguire before the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff rewrote the transcript entirely. “This is the essence of what the president communicates [to Zelensky],” Schiff said. He then continued in Trump’s voice: “’We’ve been very good to your country … But you know what? I don’t see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you though. And I’m gonna say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it … And by the way, don’t call me again. I’ll call you when you’ve done what I’ve asked.’” Schiff was later forced to apologize for this absurd attempt to cram the truth into the Democrat narrative. He said it was meant as parody. But the very fact he made the attempt is revelatory. It reveals that we are not watching a reasonable response to events or actions taken by the president, but an effort to use narrative to wrangle the truth into a shape that will justify the Democrats’ appalling dedication to their own power over the good of the nation. Well, let them do their worst — and the news media with them. Narrative can express the truth or hide it — but it can’t change it, not even a little. This Ukraine story is nonsense, like the Russia hoax before it. And, as with the Mueller Report, the truth will come out."
conservative,"For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), it’s time to fish or cut bait. Most Missouri voters are familiar with this colloquial expression; it means either take action or step back —and do something useful instead. That’s the position Pelosi finds herself in, now that Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced a resolution that would allow the Senate to dismiss the articles of impeachment if the House continues to refuse to formally transmit them to the Senate. The Republican senator’s message is as sensible as it is salient — the Constitution does not abide your half measures, and neither will we. Sen. Hawley’s proposal is by no means revolutionary. According to his resolution, if the House has failed to send the articles to the Senate after 25 days, a senator could offer a motion to dismiss “with prejudice for failure by the House of Representatives to prosecute such articles” with a simple majority vote. This idea of dismissal for want of prosecution, or “DWOP,” is commonplace in both civil and criminal litigation. To date, House Democrats’ rationalizations for holding impeachment in a perpetual state of suspension are marked by rampant hypocrisy and duplicity. A month ago, when the House announced that it would move forward with an impeachment vote, Pelosi claimed there was urgency to do so because “civilization as we know it … is at stake in the next election.” But once the House, with bipartisan opposition, did vote to impeach, House Democrats acted immediately and urgently — to go home for the holidays. The Constitution clearly establishes each chamber’s role in the impeachment process. While Article I, Section 2 gives the House the power to impeach, Section 3 unequivocally provides the Senate with “the sole Power to try all Impeachments.” This was, by no means, an inconsequential part of the Framers’ constitutional design. As Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist No. 66, dividing impeachment “between the two branches of the legislature, assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other the right of judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons both accusers and judges.” It is the Senate’s sole prerogative to resolve the impeachment process. As Hawley himself has pointed out, perpetual stalemate in the impeachment process could easily result in some sort of October surprise (a last-ditch attempt to sway the November election) or, worse still, an attack on the president’s second term following re-election. If House Democrats truly respected the will of the people, they would act now on impeachment rather than using it to influence or undermine this year’s election. If the House won’t decide whether to cast or cut the line, then Hawley, joined by 10 original co-sponsors, signaled that the Senate will. Congress already has a long list of unfinished business from 2019 and other urgent matters at hand in 2020 that are vital to the continued safety and prosperity of our country. Iran continues to make threats and escalate tensions. The border remains unsecured. Obamacare is failing, with no legislative fix in sight. And our government’s reckless spending continues to pilfer from future generations. If House Democrats still think that all these things should be placed on the back burner in order to impeach this president, they should get on with it. And if not, they should move on. But either way, Hawley is right — delaying the process while distracting from the important work that needs to be done on behalf of the American people should no longer be an option."
conservative,"Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force Commander Qassem Soleimani is no more. He died with the blood of tens of thousands of people on his hands — Americans, Syrians, Kurds, Israelis, Lebanese, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Afghans, Africans in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, and more. He was an enemy combatant of the United States and leader of a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. It is tempting just to say, “yippie” and move on. But the extraordinary number of people — including Americans, including The New York Times, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) — disapproving of President Donald Trump’s decision to have our military skillfully dispatch Soleimani to wherever he’s gone requires more comment. The Times began its story with, “Mr. Trump’s decision to kill General Soleimani was one that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had rejected, fearing it would lead to war.” The Times makes the fundamental mistake: Nothing the United States does will “lead to war.” The war is already 40 years old — we just haven’t been fighting it much. Iran declared real and operational war on the United States (and Israel) at the onset of the Islamic Republic in 1979. From the U.S. embassy takeover in 1979 to the Beirut Marine Barracks bombing in 1983 to the attacks against American troops in Iraq to the bomb plots against the Saudi ambassador in Washington and the Israeli embassy in 2011 to the capture of American naval personnel in 2016 (and major violations of the Americans’ Geneva Convention rights) to the continuing Iranian harassment of U.S. shipping in the Persian Gulf and Bab-el-Mandeb Straits, Iran has killed Americans and threatened to kill more. Soleimani was head of the Iranian militias that killed 608 American soldiers in Iraq and maimed thousands of others through the use of IEDs. He armed, trained, and commanded the Iraqi Kataib militia Hezbollah that was responsible for the killing of an American contractor in Iraq and the injuring of several American soldiers — and for attacking the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which directly precipitated the current situation. And that’s only about the United States. Soleimani’s IRGC-controlled militias sent tens of thousands of troops, mostly Pakistani and Afghan, to Syria to commit large-scale ethnic cleansing of Syrian Sunnis and precipitating the Syrian refugee crisis in Europe. Soleimani’s IRGC-controlled militias ostensibly fought against ISIS in western Iraq, but committed a variety of crimes against Iraqi Sunni civilians there, as well. The arming of Hezbollah in Lebanon with precision missiles, now aimed at Israel, is a Soleimani-led IRGC operation. The establishment of Iranian missile factories in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq is a Soleimani-led IRGC operation. At home, Pelosi and Schumer think Congress should have been notified — asserting a privilege that does not exist. For the record, President Barack Obama put American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki on a CIA “kill list” in 2010 without discussion in Congress, let alone prior congressional approval. Al-Awlaki was dispatched by an American drone in Yemen in 2011. Others, including Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang, are condemning the elimination of Soleimani out of fear of the retaliation that Iran might try to exact. Those people aren’t actually wrong. But if they believe the United States should ignore Iranian provocation or abandon the Middle East to protect ourselves here at home — it’s too late for that. Just last month, Ali Hourani, an American citizen, was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison for “helping Hezbollah and Iran prepare to strike strategic and vulnerable targets around New York City, such as federal facilities housing day care centers, critical infrastructure, counterterrorism command posts, and international airports, as well as members of the NYPD, the Mossad, and the Israel Defense Forces,” according to the federal sentencing memo. Anything Hezbollah knows, Iran knows. That, however, is less a reason to condemn the elimination of Soleimani than to understand the breadth and depth of the war Iran has long been waging. The present escalation of that war is a sign that the Iranian empire has overreached, is collapsing, and needs a “victory” against the mullahs’ “Great Satan” (U.S.) or the “Little Satan” (Israel) to justify its continued existence. The Trump administration has cut off Iran’s money supply and other countries have stopped trading with Iran, making bribery in the form of cash, weapons, arms factories, and training less and less possible. The regime, reduced to stealing Iraqi oil to sell on the black market, faces rebellion in its provinces Lebanon and Iraq — as well as at home. Opposition to Islamist clericalism appears to be on the rise in the region. Enemies are most dangerous when they see their demise on the horizon — the Battle of the Bulge was Hitler’s way of ensuring the greatest number of allied casualties before the end of the Nazi empire. That appears to be where Iran is now, that is why the dispatch of Soleimani was essential, and that is why Americans and our allies must present a united front against Iran."
conservative,"Tonight brings the year 2019 to a close. Please stay safe, everyone. And for you truly crazy masochists who will be packed like sardines tonight in New York City’s Times Square — well, as they say in the South, “bless your heart.” This past year was an eventful one, from a political perspective. From the Covington Catholic High School media imbroglio back in January through the unveiling of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s much-anticipated eponymous report in April through a slew of horrific mass shootings over the dog days of the summer through House Democrats’ (kind of/sort of) formal impeachment of President Donald Trump, 2019 pretty much saw it all. As we enter 2020, I have two main substantive political wishes to complement my electoral wish that the president be re-elected. We need less socialism and we need more law and order. It is possible that, perhaps above all else in the broader political universe, the year 2019 will be remembered by historians as the year in which unvarnished socialism became truly ascendant on the American Left. Embodied by the harrowing all-freshman congresswoman “Squad” of economically illiterate would-be despots, socialism has likely not been this popular since the fall of the Berlin Wall itself. According to Gallup, an eye-opening four in ten Americans now support some form of socialism. Perhaps even more terrifyingly, MarketWatch reports that more than a third of Millennials approve of communism itself. It is impossible to overstate how grossly irresponsible this flirtatiousness is with the economic fool’s errand of socialism and the outright evil political totalitarianism to which socialism inevitably leads: Communism. No ideology in human history has ever killed more human beings than has communism. None. Alas, as it is said, those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it. And as we enter 2020, a leading presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Loonbag-VT), is a former Soviet Union-honeymooning, hammer and sickle flag-waving communist who sided with America’s existential geopolitical foes at the very height of the Cold War. This is utter moral idiocy. Hopefully 2020 sees a resurgence of traditional American skepticism of socialism. A similarly immensely dispiriting trend, and one that unfortunately has more bipartisan support, is the rise of an all-encompassing culture of lawlessness. From weak-on-sentencing judges to the decline of bail to “First Step Act”-style early prison release of violent felons to leftist/libertarian assaults on the integrity of prosecutors to the continued war on cops to the misplaced calls for mass drug liberalization to the neo-Confederate illegality of sanctuary jurisdictions, 2019 was also marked by a general decline in pervasiveness of traditional American support for law and order. The rule of law is an indispensable piece of the broader puzzle that is the American experiment. Without robust and diligent enforcement of the law, we are nothing. The bipartisan infatuation with mass jailbreak initiatives, the likes of which bamboozled Trump into signing the First Step Act federal legislative catastrophe and which are locally responsible for recent high-profile criminals from New York to Texas being free to roam to streets and wreak havoc upon a vulnerable citizenry, simply must stop. The mentality of mollycoddling criminals and failing to stand for the victims of crime — most emphatically illegal alien crime, but certainly also crime committed from those American citizens who ought to be incarcerated — has long since moved from the realm of the merely pernicious to the realm of the full-on societally ruinous. Along with the inherent lawlessness of Supremacy Clause-defying sanctuary cities, the totality of all these attacks on law enforcement and the rule of law is to inculcate a culture of sheer anarchy. Anarchy, much like socialism and communism, is complete moral idiocy. Hopefully 2020 sees a resurgence of traditional American support for law and order. Surely that isn’t asking too much for our political environs in the year 2020. Is it?"
conservative,"Christianity Today editor Mark Galli recently prompted a flurry of often-heated discussions by offering that true Christians who support the morally challenged Manhattan business mogul and showman, President Donald Trump, are selling their souls. The author makes a case for Mr. Trump’s impeachment and removal from office by posing this interesting challenge. There is some obvious fallaciousness on display here.  Men whom we might consider “immoral” by our standards have often performed incredible acts of goodness to advance the human condition.  Students of the remarkable events in North America from 1775 to 1797 must constantly grapple with the notion that three of our most revered and important Founding Fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, engaged in the morally heinous practice of slavery.  Yet this does not compel us to abandon the principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence or toss out the Constitution.  Slavery was a far more wicked crime against God and humanity than a mean-spirited tweet.  And for his many readers who no doubt believe it to be mass infanticide, for Mr. Galli to place abortion on the same moral plane as insulting Rosie O’Donnell or being on one’s third marriage is prime facia ludicrous. There is an old expression that “no man is a hero to his valet.”  And this goes for heads of state as much as any revered position.  The White House is not a chapel.  It is the home office of the chief executive of one of three federal branches that is part of a 50-state Constitutional republic.  Over the years it has been occupied by slave-holders, drinkers, philanderers, gamblers, racists, boors, even sexual predators.  But it has only been with the advent of unfettered information overwhelming the ramparts of a once-protective press (one that hid FDR’s paralysis for years and ignored his keeping a mistress, or protected the secret of JFK’s serial infidelities) that the seedier underside of the mere mortals who temporarily reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue have become fodder for public consumption.  To look to the Oval Office for spiritual fulfilment is a fool’s errand.  Such quests for inspiration from a politician reached embarrassing levels of bizarre, almost cult-like adulation with Barack Obama. Perhaps my “whatever” attitude reeks of cynicism to some.  Who knows, maybe it is.  Politics has become so coarsened over the past decades as to be exhausting to the spirit; and the rancor did not start with Trump, but rather it created Trump.  I’m old enough to remember Reagan being lampooned by a hostile media as “an affable fool” and barely a week went by when someone wasn’t branding George W. Bush with the scarlet H of “Hitler.”  I do know that character matters.  Otherwise the reminders by Mussolini’s supporters that the trains always ran on time should have sufficed.   But in Trump’s case, in this time in our history, we Christians must take the results over ostracizing the morally deficient man.  Why?  Because the president whom Mr. Galli wishes to remove from office has been the best friend Christians and Jews, religious and non-religious alike,  have had in the White House in my lifetime. And therein lies the answer that baffles those primarily on the Left for whom Christianity and fervent belief in God is either a perplexing unknown or even something to be caricatured and attacked.  (No, people of faith do not really believe God is a white-bearded Merlin-like magician.)  The key to understanding why Christians and religious Jews support Trump can be found in why they were in his camp in 2016. On June 3, 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for president of the United States and bombastically declared, “This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal.” On January 20, 2017 many of the nearly nine-in-10 Americans who believe in God were still thinking the same after eight years of President Obama’s hostility toward religion. To say that President Trump is an unknown when it comes to his personal relationship with God, if any, is an understatement. Yet eight in 10 self-identified white, born-again or evangelical Christians voted for Trump, while just 16 percent voted for Clinton. But why? To understand why religious voters set aside their reservations and pulled the lever for Trump, and why they most likely will again in 2020, all one need do is review the record of the previous administration vis-à-vis religious institutions as well as what the current Democratic Party represents. Fifty-five percent of those who attend church or synagogue once a week voted for Trump, whereas 62 percent who never attend religious services voted for Clinton. Consider: In 2016, of those who label themselves Democrats, the largest single block of voters are what the Pew Center calls “nones” — those who have no affiliation with any organized religion. They are 28 percent of the party, up from 19 percent just in the last ten years. In the GOP, evangelicals make up 38 percent, up one percent in ten years. Why is this significant? Because the party in which faith has largely eroded has also become the base camp of the secular-progressive movement. The simple fact is that in the culture wars, this side represents the aggressors. Religious conservatives understand there will never be a perfect world; only Heaven can be Heaven. The same goes for presidents.  But with no faith, indeed no God, the Left is frantically driven to try to make a paradise of this earth. It’s a Dante-esque torture for them, as the carrot on the stick of a terrestrial Utopia can never be tasted. And so theirs is a never-ending crusade to stamp out the reminder of the fundamental flaw in their belief system—that original sin can be eradicated through government activism, and with the right laws, policies, and court verdicts. And no better ally have they had in the White House than Barack Obama. The administration Trump dethroned represented for the faithful one of the most formidable progressive antagonists in the post-modern age.   On the day Trump took the oath of office, people of faith could look back on a previous eight years of edicts, laws, and court rulings that back up this assertion. HHS mandates supported by the administration showed uncompromising dismissal of religious values, compelling Catholic hospitals to engage in family planning practices and provide services that contradicted their core beliefs in the sanctity of human life in-utero. Pittsburgh’s bishop, David Zubik, likened the mandates to “a slap to the face.” He declared: “The Obama administration has just told the Catholics of the United States, ‘To hell with you.’” White Catholics also supported Trump over Clinton by 60 percent to 37 percent. But it wasn’t just Catholics who found themselves on the receiving end of what they perceived as a secular-progressive assault on divinely inspired moral constructs they consider vital to a cohesive society.  The list of the previous administration’s hostile positions toward religion in favor of leftist activism is long. From initial abandonment of The Defense of Marriage Act and overt support of Obergefell (the same-sex marriage ruling), to opposition to the Conscience Protection Act, to secularist edicts aimed at privately held businesses, to the Little Sisters of the Poor battle — the administration presented an overarching dismissal of the Judeo-Christian values that have formed the historical and cultural bedrock of our republic. When Donald Trump placed his hand on the Bible while standing on the Capitol steps, the faithful did not look up and see one of their own per se; but they did see a President who does not disdain them. Evangelicals, Catholics, and the many other Christian and religious Jewish denominations that feel so put upon by the Left have finally found some relief in the form of a President who leans toward the authority of the states to decide the matters of culture and life. Evangelicals understand that such true federalism could have far-reaching implications re: how the courts view Roe v. Wade and other lightning-rod decisions in the culture wars.  They also understand that to achieve their aim of, to paraphrase William Buckley, standing athwart the relentless progressivism and shouting Stop! they must have a like-minded judiciary.  They see that now one-in-four circuit court judges are Trump appointees, and from Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on down, they lean toward interpreting the Constitution (which people of faith feel is on their side of the moral divide) rather than engaging in activist legislation to subvert original intent. So why did 200 evangelicals come out against Mr. Galli’s piece—sincere and as worthy of respect and reflection as it was?  Because they have a memory.  They remember what the pre-Trump atmosphere was for people of faith, and they have no desire to return to it. After eight years of torrential assaults on values that the faithful hold dear, Trump’s promise of relief was enough to prompt an Election Day coalescing around the man who is now the 45th president of the United States, warts and all.  And with another four years, who knows how much more re-configuring of the federal bench might be in the offing? As a Christian, I accept that all people are flawed.  If not, then there’d be no need for a Messiah and redemption.  But I also understand that sometimes the best policies have come from the worst of men.  Conversely, sometimes the most horrific results stem from initiatives enacted with the noblest intentions.  As Henry Adams once lamented, “It’s always the good men who do the most harm in the world.” Sometimes there are more important and immediate concerns than moral litmus tests.  As far as Donald Trump and the culture wars go, this is, perhaps, just such a moment."
conservative,"The editor-in-chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, wrote an editorial calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. In my view, this editorial only serves to confirm one of the sadder realizations of my life: that religious conviction guarantees neither moral clarity nor common sense. The gist of the editorial — and of most religious and conservative opposition to President Trump — is that any good the president has done is dwarfed by his character defects. This is an amoral view that says more about Galli than it does about the president. He and the people who share his opinion are making the following statement: No matter how much good this president does, it is less important than his character flaws. Why is this wrong? First, because it devalues policies that benefit millions of people. And second, because it is a simplistic view of character. I do not know how to assess a person’s character — including my own — outside of how one’s actions affect others. Since I agree with almost all of President Trump’s actions as president and believe they have positively affected millions of people, I have to conclude that as president, Trump thus far has been a man of particularly good character. Of course, if you think his policies have harmed millions of people, you will assess his character negatively. But that is not what never-Trump conservatives or Christians such as the Christianity Today editor-in-chief argue. They argue that his policies have indeed helped America (and even the world), but this fact is far less significant than his character. In the words of Galli: “(I)t’s time to call a spade a spade, to say that no matter how many hands we win in this political poker game, we are playing with a stacked deck of gross immorality and ethical incompetence.” This rhetorical sleight of hand reflects poorly on Galli’s intellectual and moral honesty. Galli and every other Christian and conservative opponent of the president believe their concerns are moral, and that the president’s Christian and other conservative supporters are political. This is simply wrong. I and every other supporter of the president I know support him for moral reasons, not to win a “political poker game.” Galli’s view is purely self-serving; he’s saying, “We Christian and other conservative opponents of the president think in moral terms, while Christian and other conservative supporters of the president think in political terms.” So, permit me to inform Galli and all the other people who consider themselves conservative and/or Christian that our support for the president is entirely moral. — To us, putting pressure on the Iranian regime — one of the most evil and dangerous regimes on Earth — by getting out of the Iran nuclear deal made by former President Barack Obama is a moral issue. Even New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, who loathes Trump, has written how important the president’s rejection of the Obama-Iran agreement has been. — To us, enabling millions of black Americans to find work — resulting in the lowest black unemployment rate ever recorded — is a moral issue. — To us, more Americans than ever being employed and almost 4 million Americans freed from reliance on food stamps is a moral issue. — To us, appointing more conservative judges than any president in history — over the same period of time — is a moral issue. That whether the courts, including the Supreme Court, are dominated by the left or by conservatives is dismissed by Galli as “political poker” makes one question not only Galli’s moral thinking but also his moral theology. — To us, moving the American embassy to Israel’s capital city, Jerusalem — something promised by almost every presidential candidate — is a moral issue, not to mention profoundly courageous. And courage is a moral virtue. — To us, increasing the U.S. military budget — after the severe cuts of the previous eight years — is a moral issue. As conservatives see it, the American military is the world’s greatest guarantor of world peace. Yet, none of these things matter to Galli and other misguided Christians and conservatives. What matters more to them is Trump’s occasional crude language and intemperate tweets, what he said about women in a private conversation and his having committed adultery. Regarding adultery, that sin is for spouses and God to judge. There is no connection between marital sexual fidelity and moral leadership. I wish there were. And as regards the “Access Hollywood” tape, every religious person, indeed every thinking person, should understand that there is no connection between what people say privately and their ability to be a moral leader. That’s why I wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal 20 years ago defending Hillary Clinton when she was charged with having privately expressed anti-Semitic sentiments. That the editor of Christianity Today thinks the president’s personal flaws, whatever they might be, are more important than all the good he has done for conservatives, for Christians, for Jews, for blacks and for America tells us a lot … about Galli and the decline of Christian moral thought."
conservative,"Many on the left (as opposed to liberals) have been warring on Christmas for more than a generation. Leftists always deny there is a war on Christmas and mock those who claim there is. There is a mind-blowing chutzpah or lack of self-awareness when people do something and yet deny that they are actually doing it. But the evidence is overwhelming. The left has stopped schools from calling Christmas vacations by that name — the name schools called them throughout American history until the last couple of decades. Almost every non-Christian school in America now calls Christmas vacation “winter break.” Fewer and fewer Americans, stores, companies or media wish people “merry Christmas,” preferring the neutered “happy holidays” (despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans celebrate Christmas). And in but one generation, virtually every American business has gone from having a “Christmas party” to having a “holiday party.” Having written in the past about the falsehood of “merry Christmas,” “Christmas vacation” and “Christmas party” not being “inclusive,” I will not reiterate the point here. Suffice it to say that it takes a breathtaking level of narcissism for a non-Christian to be offended by mentions of Christmas and a breathtaking level of meanness to seek to deprive the vast majority of fellow Americans of the public mention of their holiday. Rather, I want to try to explain why this has happened. The “inclusive” argument is so absurd — I am a religious Jew and cannot even fathom being offended or feeling “not included” by an invitation to a Christmas party — that there have to be other, or at least additional, reasons for the left’s neutering of Christmas. One is that the left sees in Christianity its primary ideological and political enemy. And it is right to do so. The only large-scale organized opposition to the left comes from the traditional Christian community — evangelical Protestants, traditional Catholics and faithful Mormons — and Orthodox Jews. Leftism is a secular religion, and it deems all other religions immoral and false. From Karl Marx to Vladimir Lenin to George Soros, the left has regarded religion in general and Christianity in particular as the “opiate of the masses” — a drug that dulls the masses into accepting their oppressed condition and, thereby, keeps them from engaging in revolution. The left understands that the more people believe in Christianity (and Judaism), the less chance the left has to gain power. The left doesn’t concern itself with Islam, because it perceives Islam as an ally in its war against Western civilization, and because leftists do not have the courage to confront Islam. They know that confronting religious Muslims can be fatal, whereas confronting religious Christians entails no risks. Second, the left regards Christianity in America as an intrinsic part of American national identity — an identity it wishes to erode in favor of a “world citizen” identity. The left has not only warred against Christmas; it has sought to undermine other national identity holidays. For any number of reasons, not only including the left, Americans no longer celebrate George Washington’s birthday (it has de facto been replaced by the utterly meaningless “Presidents Day”) or Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, as they did when I was a child, my father was a child and his father was a child. The only American celebrated in a national holiday is Martin Luther King Jr., which is acceptable to the left since he is not white. One proof of the left’s desire to undermine specifically American national holidays is its war on the two remaining specifically American holidays: July Fourth and Thanksgiving. The left deems Thanksgiving a historical fraud and an immoral celebration of “genocide” of the American Indians — which is what American children are now taught in many American public schools. And “happy Thanksgiving” has been replaced by “happy holidays.” As for July Fourth, The New York Times is leading the undermining of the celebration of America’s birthday by declaring that the real founding of America was 1619, the year, The Times asserts, African slaves first arrived on the American continent. Of course, there is still Veterans Day and Memorial Day, but they are not specifically American national holidays; just about every country has such holidays. But Christmas is a problem for the left. It celebrates religion, and it does so in quintessentially American ways (take American Christmas music, for example). The third and final reason is that the left is joyless. Whatever and whomever the left influences has less joy in life. I have met happy and unhappy liberals, and happy and unhappy conservatives, but I’ve never encountered a happy leftist. And the further left you go, the more angry and unhappy the people you will encounter. Happy women and happy blacks, for example, are far more likely to be conservative than on the left. Christmas is just too happy for the left. “Holly, jolly” is not a left-wing term."
conservative,"Another tough feature about radical democracy, another really unfortunate feature, is that it breaks all constraints on society. It’s obviously broken our Constitutional constraints — this happens time and time again. It’s broken our legal constraints, when people feel like they can just impose their will regardless of what the framework of our country says, but it also breaks the constraints of the moral order. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the recent special of the alleged comedian Michelle Wolf. You’ll remember her, she was at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few years ago and she made fun of Sarah Sanders, and this was something of a controversy. So Michelle Wolf’s got a new special on Netflix, and she decided to do a whole bit, a whole joke, about how killing her child made her feel like God. That’s pretty ghastly. I think it’s pretty repugnant. Most people are so shocked by that joke because it’s so real, it’s so true. It’s actually why it’s a pretty good joke, if not for all the suffering, if not for all the dead babies, if not for the reality of it — cause she actually killed her child — it would be a very funny joke if not for the victims. Why would it be a funny joke? Because it’s so true. She’s right, I’m sure she did feel very powerful. The ability to snuff out innocent life makes one feel powerful, it makes one take on the — presumed to have the authority of God. Yeah, that she’s right. That’s not a good thing. That’s a very bad thing. The impulse of radical egalitarian democracy is to make each man a god. That’s the trouble. What is the result of that? Is the result of that a good, thriving, wonderful society where we all love each other and we’re all very nice to each other? No, the result of that is a society that is coarse, and capricious, and miserable, and murderous."
conservative,"Everybody’s very up for this impeachment thing — very exciting, it’s a historic day! So much history making! Let me just explain something: History will care, I don’t. The reason I don’t is because it’s like going to a movie where you already know the ending. It’s the most predictable movie in the world. The Democrats are going to impeach, the Republicans are going to acquit in the Senate. It’s not going to have any massive impact on the election, everything in the world is baked into this cake — old shoes, human feces — everything is in the cake, and when it comes to 2020, the only factor that is not baked into the cake is who the Democrats will nominate. … I realized [Wednesday] morning, I was thinking about this with regard to how people view President Trump, because really how you view the impeachment is a referendum on how you view President Trump — and, even more than President Trump, how you feel about the broader political situation in the United States. I don’t think that many people are actually looking at the charges in this case and reading the Democrats’ 659-page report, and then reading the Republicans’ 200-page response and being like, “Well, after considering all of the transcripts and all of the facts, here’s where I come down on the legal merits of this case, on the evidentiary burden — has it been met or has it not been met?” I don’t think that most Americans are thinking that way. I think most Americans are thinking to themselves, “Is this impeachment appropriate or is this impeachment not? Are the people trying to impeach Trump politically motivated or are they motivated by just concern for the Constitution and preventing foreign countries from interfering in America’s elections?” I feel like we’ve been speaking past each other for quite a while here. There are a couple issues on which this is a referendum on Trump, and then there are a couple issues where this is a referendum on American politics as a whole, and it’s all wrapped up together in a ball, and that’s what people’s opinions on impeachment are, but it comes down to this, I think: Do you think that President Trump is a murderer or is he a coroner? Is he a political murderer or is he a political coroner? If you are on the Left, you look at President Trump and you say, look at this … look at this person. He lies frequently, he says things that are dishonest, he breaks every rule of the presidency, he says things out loud that should never be said, he gets on phone calls and he just jabbers to the president of Ukraine about his political opponents, he’s the kind of guy who will say or do anything, he’ll insult people on Twitter, he rips the media and then he degrades the view of people of the media because he sees them as his enemy, he calls them the enemy of the people. This is somebody who cannot be normalized! This is why you’ve heard Democrats say and people in the media say since literally the day he was elected and really since the day he was nominated, “We cannot accept this as the new normal.” In other words, Trump murdered all of these conventions. There were all of these conventions, that the media were trustworthy and Trump murdered it — he took it out back with a pickaxe and buried it in the eye like Leon Trotsky. That Trump has murdered civility — before this we were a republic of comedy — and you see this in the rewriting of Barack Obama’s history by the media. It has now been an accepted part of the media’s history that Barack Obama was actually a politician of comedy and unity, and spent his days trying to cut bipartisan deals, which for any of us who have a memory longer than that of the fish Dory in “Finding Nemo,” we recognize that’s a bunch of crap. But for folks on the Left, it’s like, “Well, Barack Obama, that was a man of honor and civility.” I don’t remember a lot of civility from Barack Obama, but they do. Don’t you remember those days when there was a consensus that politics stopped at water’s edge, that you never militarize foreign policy on behalf of your own political viewpoint? And now Donald Trump has wrecked that — he’s the murderer of that political consensus. The idea that we were all in it together — and it’s true domestically, too — Trump has polarized us along domestic political lines, whereas once we were unified. It is Trump who has wrecked everything! There’s the view of the Left, [and] the view of the media when it comes to impeachment, they say, “Well, if we don’t impeach now, then we’ve broken impeachment forever. If we don’t impeach now, then the very conventions of impeachment will have been destroyed for all time. Trump will have murdered them. It will just be another casualty of his evil.” The view of the Left is that Donald Trump is the political murderer — that he is Michael Meyers and that he is stalking Jamie Lee Curtis, and that Jamie Lee Curtis is all that is good and right with the American Republic. Then there is the view of the people who are, I would say, probably on the middle or on the Right, and that view is that Trump is not actually a political murderer. Yes, he exacerbates a lot of the problems that the country has already been experiencing; no, he’s not militating against any of those. But Trump is much more a coroner than he is a murder, [and] his election represents the recognition by the American people that all these things were already dead. Trump came upon the the still-warm corpse of American politics, and then he declared it dead. So Democrats, seeing a man standing over the body, are going, “Oh, that guy probably killed him, that guy’s the murderer” — and Republicans, conservatives, independents, they’re looking at Trump, they’re going, “No, that body was dead, and Trump didn’t exactly like get down on his hands and knees and perform CPR on the guy. But he ain’t a murderer, He’s the coroner, he’s the person who came along and declared all of these things dead to the media.”"
conservative,"Succinctly put, President Trump last week made one of the most positive moves to combat anti-Semitism ever seen from a world leader. But the media, always anxious to paint the president’s every action as wrong and even anti-Semitic, are acting true to form. In this case, media outlets such as The New York Times are doing tremendous harm to Jewish students on campus — and to simple fairness, to boot. The president’s executive order should be uncontroversial. It simply declares that the administration will treat anti-Semitic hatred similarly to discrimination against other minority groups under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. It states that “individuals who face discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin do not lose protection under Title VI for also being a member of a group that shares common religious practices.” Instead, the Times led with the false notion that the executive order “will effectively interpret Judaism as a race or nationality,” rather than solely as a religion. As I wrote previously, left-wing Jews immediately deemed this a “re-classification” of Jews that would lead back to concentration camps. Others claimed this serviced the trope of Jewish “disloyalty,” as if being Jewish would make someone less American. The executive order was not, as critics wailed, “anti-Semitism of the highest order.” This reaction, however, was insanity of the highest order. The basis for Jews being considered a distinct people is not the Nazis, but the Bible. The Book of Exodus teaches that God took the Jews from Egypt to be His nation, and references to the Nation of Israel abound from there onwards. But this is all a moot point, because the executive order contains no such reference to redefining Jews or Judaism as a national origin. It merely borrows language from the bipartisan Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2019, which had stalled in Congress. This is why so many Jewish members of Congress, such as Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Reps. Max Rose (D-NY) and Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), approved of this order. By Wednesday, even left-wing sources such as Vox’s Ian Millhiser and Israel’s Haaretzwere calling out the Times for its rush to judgment But the Times was unimpressed. It returned days later with a new reason why students should “fear” Trump’s executive order: It might squelch free speech and thus “backfire for Jews.” This executive order is as timely and necessary as it should be uncontroversial. On Tuesday, two murderers with links to the black nationalist and anti-Semitic “Hebrew Israelite” cult opened fire at a kosher market in Jersey City, New Jersey, killing four — including a veteran police officer and a 24-year-old rabbinical student. To be sure, hate speech is protected like any other form of speech, and no executive order can stifle it. Nonetheless, a student organization should not receive university funding to create an unsafe environment for others. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), true to form, rushed to attribute the Jersey City killings to “white supremacy” and deleted her erroneous tweet a little too late. She is anxious that Americans perceive Jew-hatred as a neo-Nazi trait, in order to cover for its most salient and pernicious current form: The storm of anti-Semitic rhetoric within our colleges and universities posing as mere “criticism of Israel.” The executive order directs federal agencies to consider the definition of anti-Semitism provided by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) when identifying evidence of discrimination. Contrary to the Times’ quote from a Jewish leftist, the IHRA definition specifically states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country” is not anti-Semitic. But modern examples of anti-Semitism include “justifying the killing or harming of Jews,” “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination,” and calling the state of Israel “a racist endeavor.” And that, of course, is the problem: The so-called “pro-Palestinian” movement does all three of these on an ongoing basis. Its map of “Palestine” is not that of the British, the Ottoman Turks, or even the Romans, but rather that of modern-day Israel. It calls Israel racist and advocates for its destruction — all while attempting to replicate the Nazi boycott under the name “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions.” The movement in general, and the Students for Justice in Palestine on-campus organization in particular, regularly holds events honoring murderers of Jews. It is no surprise, then, that these bigots are protesting the executive order. Indeed, under the new rules, anti-Semitic hatred cloaked as “anti-Israel advocacy” will be no more acceptable than preaching white supremacy. That is how it should be. Anyone has the right to voice hatred and bigotry — but not with taxpayer funding. Unlike leftist Jews with little real attachment to Judaism, the Orthodox Jewish community firmly adheres to our ancient faith — and Orthodox Jews are much more likely to experience anti-Semitism. A recent survey by Ami Magazine found that 92.5% of Orthodox Jews believed that President Trump and the Republicans were more dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, compared to 1.5% who gave the nod to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the Democrats. That is a stark contrast. After this executive order, it is likely that the president’s support will trend even higher. History has taught us that anti-Semitism, like all forms of racism, must be nipped in the bud before it metastasizes into a societal epidemic. President Trump is working to stop the irrational hatred of Jews from spreading, but the media are too consumed with their own irrational hatred of the president to care."
conservative,"Dr. Richard Ebeling, professor of economics at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, and my longtime friend and colleague, has written an important article, “Business Ethics and Morality of the Marketplace,” appearing in the American Institute for Economic Research. Its importance and timeliness is enhanced by so many of America’s youth, led by academic hacks, having fallen prey to the siren song of socialism. In a key section of his article, Ebeling lays out what he calls the ethical principles of free markets. He says: “The hallmark of a truly free market is that all associations and relationships are based on voluntary agreement and mutual consent. Another way of saying this is that in the free market society, people are morally and legally viewed as sovereign individuals possessing rights to their life, liberty, and honestly acquired property, who may not be coerced into any transaction that they do not consider being to their personal betterment and advantage.” Ebeling says that the rules of a free market are simple and easy to understand: “You don’t kill, you don’t steal, and you don’t cheat through fraud or misrepresentation. You can only improve your own position by improving the circumstances of others. Your talents, abilities, and efforts must all be focused on one thing: what will others take in trade from you for the revenues you want to earn as the source of your own income and profits?” For many people, profit has become a dirty word and as such has generated slogans such as “people before profits.” Many believe the pursuit of profits is the source of mankind’s troubles. However, it’s often the absence of profit motivation that’s the true villain. For example, contrast the number of complaints heard about profit-oriented establishments such as computer stores, supermarkets and clothing stores to the complaints that one hears about nonprofit establishments such as the U.S. Post Office, the public education system and departments of motor vehicles. Computer stores, supermarkets and clothing stores face competition and must satisfy customers to earn profits and stay in business. Postal workers, public teachers and department of motor vehicles employees depend on politicians and coercion to get their pay. They stay in business whether customers are satisfied with their services or not. In a free market society, income is neither taken nor distributed. Income is earned by serving one’s fellow man. Say I mow your lawn. When I’m finished, you pay me $50. Then, I go to my grocer and demand, “Give me two pounds of sirloin and a six-pack of beer that my fellow man produced.” In effect, the grocer asks: “Williams, what did you do to deserve a claim on what your fellow man produced?” I say, “I served him.” The grocer says, “Prove it.” That’s when I pull out the $50. We might think of dollars as “certificates of performance,” proof of serving our fellow man. Free markets are morally superior to other economic systems. To have a claim on what my fellow man produces, I’m forced to serve him. Contrast that requirement to government handouts, where a politician says to me: “You don’t have to get out in that hot sun to mow your fellow man’s lawn. Vote for me and I’ll take what your fellow man produces and give it to you.” Ebeling says that those deserving condemnation are those who use government coercion to gain at the expense of others. There are thousands of such examples: government subsidies at taxpayers’ expense, paying farmers not to grow crops or guaranteeing them a minimum price paid for through tax dollars and higher prices for consumers, regulations that limit entry into various professions and occupations, regulations that limit consumer choice, and corporate handouts and bailouts. In a word or so, our protest should not be against capitalism. People should protest crony capitalism, where people use the political arena to buy government favors. If millennials and others want to wage war against government favors and crony capitalism, I’m with them 100%. But I’m all too afraid that anti-capitalists just want their share of the government loot."
conservative,"I’m fascinated by the debate that has been raging these past several days among conservatives around the issue of pornography. I’m happy to accept blame for helping to start this scuffle because I think it has been a clarifying moment for conservatism. As Jane Coaston outlined in her fair and insightful reporting at Vox, the dispute over porn regulation really springs from a more fundamental disagreement about the actual purpose of government. Guys like Sohrab Ahmari have come down on the pro-regulation side, while the libertarians at Reason have settled, unsurprisingly, on the other. The dividing line even runs through The Daily Wire. My colleagues Michael Knowles and Josh Hammer join Ahmari, myself, and others in the view that government has a legitimate role in battling the porn epidemic, while Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing say that it should not have a substantial role — and any role, if there is one, should not include an outright ban. I think everyone cited above has contributed thoughtfully to the discussion, and I’m not just saying that because two of them happen to sign my paychecks. But through this whole back-and-forth, I haven’t seen anyone engage with what I consider to be my strongest argument. Putting aside, for a moment, the philosophical  discussion about the nature of government and the state’s role in preserving the common good — an important conversation, but one that leads us far into the weeds and loses sight of the original subject in the process — I’d like to re-emphasize a very simple point I’ve made about the porn problem, specifically. The defense of pornography, or at least of its remaining legal and mostly unregulated, seems to hinge on the fact that the content is produced and viewed by consenting adults. If viewers do not consent to viewing a sexual act, we all presumably agree that a crime has occurred. It would seem to strain the bounds of the most radical libertarianism to argue that a group of adults are within their rights to have an orgy on the subway, for example. Porn is different, it’s argued, because you only view it if you seek it out. If viewers of porn were not consenting — if internet porn were of such a nature that millions of people were forced to encounter it against their will every year — then it would seem that the argument against prohibition or regulation begins to crumble. Well, I think it has already crumbled because indeed millions of people are exposed to it every year against their will and consent. Those defending the legality of porn seem to be ignoring this group of victims, and I think that is an insurmountable moral and logical flaw in their position. Children are first exposed to porn at the age of 11, on average. As we speak right now, there are no doubt millions of minors, some as young as five or six years old, watching adults have sex on the internet. This is an indisputable fact. Does the fact not blow to smithereens the “consent” excuse offered by the other side? Our legal system rests on the assumption that minors cannot consent to engage in sexual acts. If an adult has sex with a child, the adult is guilty of rape no matter if the child verbally agreed or not. In our society, we understand that children lack the mental and emotional maturity to make an informed decision in this area. To deny that is to literally defend pedophilia. Well, if children cannot consent to engage in a sexual act, does it not inevitably follow that they cannot consent to witness such an act? If they cannot consent as a second-party participant, neither can they consent as a third-party participant. Thus, every child who watches porn does so, by definition, without consent. Again: I don’t see how you can quibble with this argument without also quibbling with the logic for criminalizing pedophilic behavior. I’m not saying that the people on the opposite side of this issue are trying to legalize pedophilia. I’m saying that they fail to appreciate how our laws against pedophilia also provide a basis for pornography regulation. This all means that every “consenting adult” who posts hardcore sex videos to the internet does so knowing that children can very easily access and view it. They are putting it, as it were, within reach of the child. If the child reaches for it, who do we blame? Is it the child’s fault or the fault of the person who put it there? I would argue that every child who has viewed internet pornography is a victim of abuse. And the abuser is the person who posted that content where a child, with no trouble at all, could find it. Indeed, the internet porn industry makes hundreds of millions of dollars every year on children. Each hit to a site like Pornhub is monetized. If millions of children go on that site — which they do, because there’s nothing to stop them — then Pornhub profits to the tune of millions on the psychological and sexual abuse of children. If you don’t think the government has an interest in the common good, broadly speaking, will you admit that it at least has an interest in preventing people from making millions on providing pornography to 12-year-olds? The obvious dodge here is to lay the onus entirely at the feet of parents. “It’s not the pornographer’s fault,” critics will respond. “It’s up to the parent to stop their kids from seeing this stuff.” I find this rejoinder to be profoundly lazy. It’s true that parents should be doing all they can to shield their children from the filth on the internet, but it’s also true that the internet is so ubiquitous that parents cannot, on their own, do a sufficient job in this regard. Even if the child has no phone and no internet access at home — or, more likely, regulated internet access at home — he can still go almost anywhere else and access the internet dozens of different ways. Short of moving into a cave in the desert, a parent can only provide partial cover. But partial cover, in the end, is only a little better than no cover at all. Besides, this does nothing to relieve the responsibility of the person posting the content in the first place. Even if every child exposed to porn has ineffectual and inattentive parents (which is most emphatically not the case), that still doesn’t explain why anyone should have the right to post sex videos on a public forum where children can easily access them. It might be true that some children who are molested could have been saved that trauma had their parents been more vigilant, but that does absolutely nothing at all to excuse the man who did the molesting. The same holds true for pornographers. The question is this: Do we have a natural human right to post hardcore sex videos online where children can see them? Anyone who says “yes” has an extremely confused and hopelessly ambiguous conception of human rights. The rational people who say “no,” however, must weigh whether a person’s privilege to post such content outweighs the right of a child to be free from sexual abuse and trauma. This does not have to be a deeply philosophical debate about philosophies of governance and so on. This can be much simpler. You do not have a right to expose children to sexually explicit content. Children do have a right to certain basic legal protections. That fact alone, in my view, is enough to settle the argument."
conservative,"Progressives insist that they are the ambassadors of tolerance and compassion and have done so now for decades. They clamor for their endless list of causes behind the garish guise of these two high virtues and insist they stand on the moral high ground in all social issues. Much to the chagrin of progressives, however, the roots of tolerance and compassion are decidedly religious in origin and remain so. They actually form the Golden Rule. And while the Golden Rule gets bandied about too often to count these days, many often forget that the maxim is inherently religious. That is, it simply would not exist were it not for religion. After all, it’s a foundational maxim for all the major religious traditions of the world. Even the Wikipedia entry states as much as does the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: All known world religions address the nature of good and evil and commend ways of achieving human well-being…there is a substantial overlap between many of these conceptions of the good as witnessed by the commending of the Golden Rule. Here’s a key proviso in relation to the Golden Rule though. It only makes sense in a decidedly religious context. Religious faith not only provides a foundation for the Golden Rule but also guideposts. A sense of wholesome direction and discipline are established. Bereft of the necessary religious foundations, tolerance and compassion mutate into vacuous pity and a complete disregard for boundaries. Almost anything is allowed. We are reduced to bestial impulses. Wanton hedonism emerges alongside blinding narcissism under very deviant definitions of tolerance and compassion. Tolerance, in particular, warps into “anything goes and you’re not allowed to criticize it.” This is evident among progressives now more than ever and, sadly, in America at large today. Unlike religious faith, when one finally decides to peer behind the curtain of progressive claims to such virtues, one finds that no moral foundation whatsoever exists. Their ideas are rooted in nihilism and narcissism. At best, they draw from comic books, films and television shows. These have formed a hopelessly insular and circular narrative for them ad nauseam. For example, the Star Wars universe has become a moral guidepost for many progressives. I’m not kidding. Last I checked though, George Lucas is not some grand harbinger of wisdom. In fact, the very first Star Wars trilogy alongside pretty much the entire genre of fantasy draws from J.R.R. Tolkien and his seminal classic, The Lord of The Rings. Here’s a fun fact for progressives: Tolkien was very much a devout Catholic and says as much in his own words regarding his work: The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work. Tolerance and compassion remain fundamentally religious values. Sadly, progressives have not only abandoned religious wisdom – wisdom that has remained for centuries upon centuries – they generally malign the very notion of religious faith unless it involves some silly New Age dreck from the likes of Ram Dass, Marianne Williamson, or Osho and his fleet of Rolls Royces. It’s no wonder that such high virtues have devolved into self-serving progressive virtue-signaling."
conservative,"On Tuesday’s episode of “The Ben Shapiro Show,” the Daily Wire editor-in-chief talks about a New York Times article that raises the issue of “self-coupling.” Video and partial transcript below: This is why the culture wars matter so much — I present to you, as Exhibit A in the pitch that the Left is making, this article from yesterday in The New York Times by an associate professor of religious studies at Skidmore College, Bradley Onishi, [who asks], “Could I be my own soulmate?” Are you your own soulmate? The article describes Emma Watson, the actress, and Lizzo, the rapper and flautist, who are both saying that they are their own One — that they are self-coupling. That’s ignoring the several thousand years before that, where marriage was actually a pretty congenial relationship. The redefinition of marriage into one choice among many, just something that you do if you feel like it — the problem is that that may work for a very, I would say very, very limited coterie of people who read The New York Times. It does not work broadly across the United States. But our cultural institutions are all nationalized: Hollywood is nationalized, Netflix is nationalized, The New York Times is nationalized, Facebook is nationalized, and that means that the social bleed over effect, the social trickle-down effect of leftist social policy, which, by the way, is not even engaged in by people at the upper echelons in places like New York and California. One of the peculiar things you’ll find about Hollywood is the same people who are routinely preaching the virtues of bleeding-edge social leftism — get rid of marriage, have any relationship you want, open marriages, polyamory — those same people tend to get married at higher rates than a lot of people who are actually not living in those areas. They tend not to have kids out of wedlock, particularly a lot, and if they do have kids out of wedlock, they can afford it because they’re very wealthy. Those social messages do not apply equally to everyone. In other words, just as with every other policy in human life, not all policies affect everybody equally. The fact that folks on the Left seem to think that policies undertaken by liberal elites over at The New York Times or in Hollywood, that those policies affect people in downtrodden economic areas the same way that they do in upper/elite establishments that discarded religion as a social fabric decades ago, just demonstrates a tremendous level of ignorance. Trying to re-shift these definitions of fundamental institutions — that is indeed creating a phenomenon in which the United States is dividing. These [three] phenomena — income inequality rising, the changes in the economy, and the bleed over of social liberalism — this is leading to a toxic brew. Now, there are people on the Right and the Left who think that the way to fix this is to fix the economic side. The way we’re gonna do this with redistributionism! You’ve got Andrew Yang proposing universal basic income on the Democratic side, or you have people like — as I’ve said — Tucker Carlson talking about regulating out of existence self-driving cars, stopping economic progress, limiting trade, bringing back all these jobs to manufacturing areas, as though that’s ever really going to happen. I have serious doubts about that, considering the technology has basically put a lot of these jobs out of commission. Then, there is the stuff that is actually in the control of the people who are living today, and that is making the next right decision. The fact is that there are certain factors in your life that are fundamentally going to guarantee [that you] have a better shot at life — finishing high school, not having kids out of wedlock, getting married. These things actually change your life in ways for the better, and the fact that our culture is so focused in on a sort of Marxist materialism, in which if we solve your economic circumstance, that this will solve all of your other problems — this is not right. Solving the problem of making right and moral decisions that better your life — that is how your life gets better. That means taking seriously the fundamental social institutions that [have] been broken by the Left since the 1960s, focusing on restoring those — because those are things you can do. Not things that you have to wait for some government savior to do — and, by the way, those government saviors ain’t showing up. Income inequality is breaking out in major blue cities, where they’ve gotten rid of the social institutions and where the ladder to success doesn’t exist even for the underclass in those cities themselves. Forget about red areas versus blue areas — in the cities themselves. You need a restoration of personal responsibility in order to lead to a restoration of the ladder to success that does exist for people who make the best possible decision."
conservative,"Colin Kaepernick’s latest bid for attention — since he obviously doesn’t want to play quarterback in the NFL — he trashed the United States on “Unthanksgiving Day,” which I guess is sort of like your “Unbirthday” in Alice in Wonderland … [Kaepernick] said that he was accusing the United States of having stolen billions of acres of land from indigenous people, and then he released a video on his Twitter account to play into all this. So here’s Colin Kaepernick, a millionaire thanks to the Western system he is currently criticizing, in America, a country that he apparently really does not like in many ways. Here he is cutting a video on Unthanksgiving Day because apparently we’re not supposed to be thankful to God that we live in this country, we’re not supposed to be thankful to God that Western civilization arrived on these shores. We’re supposed to pretend that everything would’ve been better for the world if Europeans had never come to the continent, which again, that is not to discount any of the evils Europeans committed when arriving on this continent. But to pretend that the world would be a better place, broadly speaking, if Europeans had never colonized the United States, is to be completely ignorant of world history, economics, and pretty much everything else. Here’s Colin Kaepernick doing that routine, presumably — well, leaning back in his mansion and watching this thing on his Twitter account created on his iPhone. Okay, it is certainly worthwhile to recognize that the United States is based on European peoples coming to land that they did not originally discover — there were people here already, and then taking over that land. It is also important to recognize that as the entire history of human migration over the course of all of human history — literally all of it — and that before the Europeans even arrived on this continent, there were plenty of people who were colonizing each other’s lands. There were internecine warfare between Native American tribes, there were people who were colonizing other people’s land — this has been happening throughout history. To single out European colonization of the Americas as unique evil in the history of the world is simply ridiculous. Not only is [it] ridiculous, it’s particularly ridiculous on Thanksgiving, which is a day specifically designated to be tolerant and open. Thanksgiving is a day that was specifically created in order to recognize the common humanity between Native Americans and European peoples who arrived on the continent. It’s a ridiculous take on American history — a context-free take on American history — but unfortunately, it is this sort of view of America that is splitting the country."
conservative,"Two weeks ago, two prominent evangelical supporters of President Donald Trump, Eric Metaxas and Franklin Graham, had a discussion about the election, the current political situation and opposition to the President. “It’s a very bizarre situation to be living in a country where some people seem to exist to undermine the president of the United States. It’s just a bizarre time for most Americans,” said author and radio show host Eric Metaxas. “Well, I believe it’s almost a demonic power that is trying,” Graham began before being interrupted by Metaxas who replied, “I would disagree. It’s not almost demonic. You know and I know, at the heart, it’s a spiritual battle.” They then pivoted immediately into the economy as evidence of how good people have it. The mainstream media rushed to characterize Graham as suggesting all opposition to the President is demonic. It is naturally understandable, given the conversation, that they would go there. But then that raises the question of all the opposition to Barack Obama when he was President. Romans 13:1-2 reads, “Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.” Both Obama and Trump were put into the presidency as part of God’s master plan. If you are a Christian, you cannot deny this. Certainly, scripture is clear that man’s law does not trump God’s law. Refusing to pay for abortions despite a government mandate is scriptural. Praying for the President and paying taxes, even if you oppose where the money is going, is also scriptural. The problem with the conversation, as with so many conversations these days, is that too many want to characterize their political opponents as enemies, not just opponents. I would agree that something wicked is stirring right now. Scripture is clear there are things unseen, both good and bad. We should be perturbed at the rise of mass shootings, the renewed aggressiveness of abortion rights advocates, the censorious demands of LGBT activists and more. We should also be perturbed at the number of Christians who think they need a strong man in the White House to protect them when they claim to worship the God of the universe. Americans across the political spectrum need an abundance of grace more than ever right now. We — and I use “we” intentionally — are all so quick to presume bad motives these days. We are all so quick to presume someone is bad because they have a different worldview or ideology. Our society cannot continue on if we are not willing to live and let live. Our founders embraced the idea of federalism because they knew a new nation as diverse as ours should be allowed communities of common interest. Unfortunately, the United States Supreme Court and activists across the country have long worked to exterminate communities of interest. The values of urban, progressive areas are increasingly legally required to be the values of socially conservative areas. A decade ago, progressive activists asked, “How will my gay marriage affect you?” The answer, a decade later, is that my business may be shut down if I do not provide you goods and services. My children will be ostracized if they do not run from their parents’ faith. Evil preaches tolerance until it is dominant and then it seeks to silence good. The only cure for the rise of intolerances and censoriousness is grace. We must be willing to understand that those who fundamentally disagree with us simply have a different understanding of the world. We must work to find common ground where we can and show grace where we cannot. We must be willing to let others live their lives in ways fundamentally different from our own and not feel compelled to have them conform. If we, as a nation, are to survive as one people, we must be willing to be friends in disagreement."
conservative,"Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is “foundational” and that people of color were under “mortal threat” from the “white supremacist in the White House.” Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that “systemic racism” will “be with us” no matter who is in the White House. Senator Cory Booker called for “attacking systemic racism” in the “racially biased” criminal justice system. Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a “racially biased” criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, “A Platform of Urban Decline,” which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before. According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: “According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well.” There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races. White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a “mortal threat” from the “white supremacist in the White House” are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality. Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an “unforgivable outburst of white supremacy.” Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: “If we are honest with ourselves,” too many fathers are “missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men.” Then-Senator Obama went on to say, “Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.” White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago. Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system."
conservative,"The writer Robert Ruark titled one of his novels after a South African proverb: “If a man does away with his traditional way of living and throws away his good customs, he had better first make certain that he has something of value to replace them.” This Thanksgiving, many of us will express gratitude for the traditions and good customs of the United States of America: our freedom of speech and religion, our right to defend ourselves by force of arms, our respect for the individual man and woman and our commitment to the restraints on government that leave them free. But many of our friends on the left — including some of those who aspire to be president — don’t share our gratitude. “America was never great,” says Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo echoes him: “America was never that great.” “This country was founded on racism,” says Beto O’Rourke. The New York Times agrees. They tell us holidays like Columbus Day and Thanksgiving celebrate imperialism and genocide. They want to end free speech and instead censor hate speech — which is to say, any speech they hate. They want to penalize religion for not sharing the passing moral fancies of the present day. They want to strip us of our guns and leave us defenseless before their lust for more and more power. No doubt our country, being full of human beings, is imperfect and can always improve. But what is the “something of value” that the left is offering us instead of our traditions and customs of freedom? With what do they plan to replace the country the rest of us love? The left is ceaselessly on the attack against a fantastical network of intersectional oppression, a made-up world in which American women and minorities face systematic injustice at the hands of evil white men. But what can we look forward to when that wicked fantasy system is overturned? Can you ever imagine the left, with its victim mentality, announcing itself free of victimhood? Can you ever imagine social justice warriors declaring the war is over? It will never happen. They are offering to replace freedom — its challenges and delights — with an endless series of accusations, fueled by rage, envy and an unjustified hunger for revenge. They call for reparations for past sins like slavery and segregation. But can you imagine some pay-off that will put an end to the bitterness that’s at the center of their philosophy? How much money will be enough? What bribe will convince those who never suffered to forgive us for sins we never committed? The left wants to erase the unfairness of gender, that act of God that assigns different roles in the work of human creation and nurturing to each of the two sexes. But what utopian perfection do you think will arise when men no longer bear the responsibilities of men and women abandon the functions of women? The left has taken the chief consolation of life and turned it into a dysfunctional misery. With what do they plan to replace it? The left’s relentless wholesale assault on this, the last best hope of earth, depends on our never stopping to ask what they are actually offering in its stead. American traditions and customs have raised this country to unimaginable heights of freedom, wealth and power. We should be grateful for them always and never abandon them unless and until we can truly replace them with something of value."
conservative,"Advice columns abound instructing leftists on how to endure the misery of conversing with conservative relatives at Thanksgiving. The genre has become a holiday tradition. The L.A. Times outlined “what to do if your crazy right-wing uncle comes to Thanksgiving.” The New York Times explained “How to have a conservation with your crazy [conservative] uncle over the holidays.” Mother Jones warned, “You won’t change your cranky conservative uncle in one dinner conversation.” Someone seems cranky, but I don’t think it’s your conservative uncle. The articles always run in one direction, preparing leftists for their annual interaction with a conservative. One rarely, if ever, sees a think piece bracing conservatives to deal with their crazy leftist nieces. What would be the need? Politics might be religion for the Left, but conservatives understand there is more to life than politics. Besides, we live in a leftist culture. We encounter leftism every time we turn on a screen. We understand their arguments better than they understand ours, and we don’t need to spoil our dinner with banal bickering over politicians. For the Left, Thanksgiving is about politics; for the Right, politics is about thanksgiving. The different approaches to holiday conversation come from opposing views of politics. The leftist vision of politics as a matter of rights begets an attitude of grievance and entitlement. If ”the political is the personal,” as the radicals of the 1960s insisted, then all personal interactions must take on an activist agenda. As GQ told its left-wing audience, “It’s your civic duty to ruin Thanksgiving by bringing up Trump this Turkey Day,” urging them to “consider making life HELL for a few of your relatives.” The conservative vision regards politics more as a matter of gratitude than entitlement—duty over rights. We have inherited so much: a wonderful country, a culture of freedom and abundance, even our life itself, earned through no effort of our own but bequeathed as a gift from our forefathers. The leftist unease at Thanksgiving represents an unease with thanksgiving more generally. Revisionist attacks on our Pilgrim forefathers at Plymouth express a fundamental ingratitude for the country they gave us. In certain leftist circles, it has become fashionable to refer to Thanksgiving as the ”National Day of Mourning” to commemorate rather than celebrate alleged Puritan crimes against defenseless Native Americans. This anti-historical narrative commits a grave injustice to both the English and the Indians: it robs the Pilgrims of their virtue and the Indians of their dignity. Worst of all, the revisionism fuels the grievance politics that ails our nation four centuries after the landing of the Mayflower. Your left-wing niece won’t change her right-wing uncle’s voting habits over mashed potatoes, you won’t change hers, and who really cares anyway? De gustibus non est disputandum—there’s no accounting for taste. A more edifying topic for the Thanksgiving table than debates over political preference is the history of Thanksgiving itself, an objective fact despite decades of revision. The sheer providence of the Mayflower’s landing should amaze even the most hardened skeptic. After an arduous journey marked by treachery, delays, and storms that blew the ship hundreds of miles off course, the Mayflower landed at Plymouth in December of 1620. The passengers passed the first winter on the ship, fearing hostile weather and even more hostile natives. When the Pilgrims disembarked in early spring, they met the Abenaki sagamore Samoset, who greeted them with two words: “Welcome, Englishmen!” Samoset possessed a startling but bare knowledge of English, acquired after meeting some British fishermen in Maine. Fortunately, Samoset introduced the Pilgrims to Squanto, a Patuxet Indian who had been abducted, brought to Spain as a slave, freed by Catholic monks, likely baptized, ferried to London, and somehow returned to Newfoundland. When he arrived back in North America, Squanto made his way down the coast, discovered that his tribe had been wiped out by disease, and ended up as a captive of the Pokanoket sachem Massasoit precisely at the spot where the Mayflower had accidentally landed. The Pilgrims had found the one Indian in the Western Hemisphere with a command of their language, their native land, and their religion. Squanto brokered an alliance between the Plymouth colonists and Massasoit, who used the English to oppose the Narragansetts and establish the Wampanoag nation. The English and the natives celebrated this new partnership in October 1621 with a three-day festival of Thanksgiving. The alliance nearly broke down when the settlers refused to hand Squanto to Massasoit, who hoped to kill the Patuxet interpreter for perceived treachery. The Pilgrims refused and saved Squanto’s life, a service they performed for Massasoit himself in 1623. On his deathbed, Massasoit called for Plymouth colonist Edward Winslow to bid him farewell. But Winslow refused to say goodbye and managed to revive the sachem with medicine, a tongue-scraping, and chicken broth. Massasoit in turn repaid that favor by warning the English of an impending attack from the Massachusetts tribe, which the English repelled with the help of Wampanoag forces. The partnership between the English and the Wampanoags lasted through the death of Squanto, who asked on his deathbed that Governor Bradford pray for him so that he “might go to the Englishmen’s God in heaven.” The friendship lasted through the death of Massasoit, who cherished the friendship of the English to his last days. It even persisted through the reign of Massasoit’s son Alexander and only broke down in 1675, when Massasoit’s younger son Philip mistakenly blamed the English for Alexander’s death. That misunderstanding led to three years of brutal warfare that pitted various Indian tribes against one another and forever destroyed the close relations of the natives to the settlers. Your left-wing niece has probably never heard that story, having learned instead the revisionist propaganda that depicts the Plymouth colonists as inhuman and their native neighbors as sub-human. In reality, they were men, English and Indian, in all their complexity and all their imperfection. They were neither angels nor devils. In fact, they bore a striking resemblance to us, albeit perhaps a bit more courageous, accomplished, and dignified. We remain neither angels nor devils—even the crazy conservative uncles. The ideological view of past and present may provoke grievance and resentment, but the reality inspires thanksgiving."
conservative,"Jeff Bezos just donated $98.5 million to help the homeless. Almost a hundred million dollars to help the homeless. There is no way to be upset about this, right? Oh, you’re wrong. You’re not living in 2019. Jeremy Corbyn, who is the leftist leader in Britain, tweeted out, quote, “That’s 0.09% of your net worth. Just pay your taxes.” By the way, he does pay his taxes. There was — a few years ago, Amazon was reinvesting money in their business, so they didn’t pay a lot of taxes. They pay a lot of taxes now. Also, how much money has Jeremy Corbyn ever given to the homeless? First of all, how much money [has] Jeremy Corbyn ever paid in taxes? Not a lot of it. How much money [has] he ever given to the homeless? Less than one hundred million dollars? Yeah, I would bet so. Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself, buddy. Ask yourself this question, how much money did you give to charity this year? Most likely, if you’re listening to the show, you’re not one of these people who scream and yell at everyone else for things that they did or didn’t do. But if you are, if somehow someone on Twitter, in the Twitter world is watching or listening to this, how much money did you give to charity yourself? Most people don’t give a lot of money to charity. Most people don’t even think about it. But the secret is, you’re not going to miss that money. … What this all brings up at a deeper, cultural level is that there are two ways of looking at the world. It is very important. When [we are] two days away from Thanksgiving: Two ways of looking at the world, one from a position of entitlement, one from a position of gratitude. If you are looking at the world from a position of entitlement, you are most likely going to look at politics primarily as a matter of “rights.” You’re going to see every little slight that was ever done to you, you’re going to imagine — completely imagine — new slights committed against you, like that Indian woman who says that she doesn’t like that white people like Indian food. You’re going to judge others by their actions and you’re going to judge yourself by your intentions. You are going to hoard rather than to give; you are going to be miserable. How about the flip side? If you look at life primarily from an attitude of gratitude, you are going to look at politics primarily as a matter of duty, not of rights. Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. You are going to forgive slights against you — you might not even notice half of them — and you are not going to sit around imagining new slights. You’re gonna be happy for the life that you have, you are going to give people a break, and you’re going to be thankful that you don’t get called out on all of the terrible things that you do. You are going to give freely, you are going to be much happier because you are going to realize that you did not invent your life. You are not responsible for giving yourself your own life. Life was a gift, you should be very happy to have it. Something to think about as we move into Thanksgiving. "
conservative,"“The Hunt”, a film about a group of people who are kidnapped and hunted by rich liberal “elites” for fun, made headlines as debate broke out over the decision to delay its release. The delay, Universal said, was deemed the most appropriate action after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Although intended as satire, many people objected to the political messages that the film could send about both Democrats and Republicans. President Donald Trump weighed in on the debate via Twitter: “Liberal Hollywood is Racist at the highest level, and with great Anger and Hate!” Is President Trump right? Has Hollywood been hijacked as an angry and hateful medium used by the Left? According to the Center for Responsive Politics, individuals and firms in the television, movie, and music industries contributed 80% of the $84 million donated in 2016 to Democrats. Despite the fact that a large portion of Hollywood is made up of liberals, there are still a handful of outspoken conservatives who have built their entertainment careers without subduing or hiding their political beliefs. Celebrities such as Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, Tim Allen, and Arnold Schwarznegger have all maintained careers in Hollywood while still promoting their conservative beliefs through tweets, public support for candidates, and fundraising. Although there are conservatives in Hollywood who are not afraid to voice their opinions or publicly support President Trump, not many of them are women. In fact, of Newsmax’s 50 Most Influential Hollywood Conservatives in 2017, less than 20% were women. And of these female directors, actresses, models, and singers, only six were actively proclaiming their support for conservative values, the Republican Party, or a right-leaning candidate. For example, singer Joy Villa wore a dress to the 2017 Grammy Awards emblazoned with President Trump’s 2016 election slogan, “Make America Great Again.” And then, in 2018 and 2019, she wore dresses that clearly showed her support for the pro-life movement and the border wall. The other two women on the Newsmax list, Heather Locklear and Hillary Duff, however, are just registered Republicans who do not tweet or give statements to the press about their political beliefs. Why don’t these conservative women speak up? Why not use their platforms to share their beliefs? It is clear from social media, television, radio, and pretty much any form of technology that there are many outspoken women in Hollywood. Actresses, directors, TV personalities, and models like Mindy Kaling, Meryl Streep, and Beyoncé are all vocal about where they stand on liberal issues. Just last month, TV personality and model Chrissy Teigen fired back at conservative activist and Trump supporter Candace Owens, calling her a “dumb, soulless, pandering ghoul” for Owens’ criticism of celebrities who cancelled their membership to Soul Cycle after the parent company’s chairperson agreed to host a fundraiser for the Trump campaign. Taylor Swift recently became vocal in her music about her political stance and even praised former President Barack Obama’s time in office. Like Teigen and Swift, many of these left-leaning women are not afraid to voice their disagreement or advocate for what they think is right. Although there is nothing wrong with using a platform to promote a certain ideological stance, it becomes problematic when only a small portion of the wide spectrum of ideologies is represented. Although it can be difficult to risk a reputation in an atmosphere that places so much emphasis on it, conservative women in the entertainment industry should be more outspoken about their beliefs to promote a more balanced viewpoint. Conservative women played a large role in the 2016 election and, therefore, should not feel as though their opinions are discounted in any way. Conservative celebrities, especially women: Now is your chance to speak up. You should use your spotlight to promote more than just one political narrative. Be bold and show the world that conservative women like you can make a difference."
conservative,"The enigmatic Gulf emirate of Qatar, which is obscenely wealthy due to its fortuitous location above the world’s largest natural gas field, has a longstanding problem with Sunni jihadism. The wealthy petrochemical sheikh minority of the majority slave state Qatari populace is, along with Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, disproportionately responsible for funding and exporting more radical Sunni Islamism than any other cloistered clerisy the world over. The Qatari ruling class proudly hosts Islamist cleric Yusuf Al Qaradawi, the Muslim Brotherhood‘s de facto global caliph, and has long been the preeminent state bankroller of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Pro-terror network Al Jazeera also serves as a state-run Qatari propaganda outfit, and it is the evil bile spewing from Al Jazeera’s airwaves that led more moderate Sunni Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to boycott and embargo Qatar in 2017. Counter-jihadist activist David Reaboi put it well at The Washington Times in February: Now, according to an exclusive Fox News report from this past weekend, Qatar — which, despite alienating its fellow Sunni Gulf states, maintains a cozy relationship with the terror-supporting Iranian mullahs — has once again revealed its true colors for the world to see. As reported by Benjamin Weinthal, Fox News obtained a report alleging that “Qatar had advance knowledge on an Iranian attack on four commercial vessels in the Gulf of Oman in May and may have failed to warn its U.S., French, and British allies.” In other words, Qatar duplicitously sided with the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism over its purported Western “allies.” The only thing that is surprising about such Qatari duplicity is that anyone in the West is still surprised by it. Qatar has long been the proverbial “weakest link” of the Sunni world, utilizing aggressive governmental lobbying, outlandish flaunting of its petro-infused wealth to sic more A-list politicos onto its dole, and intensive funding of American think tank and higher education institutions to inculcate an insidious pro-Qatar message. As reported by the Daily Caller, Qatar was the number one foreign state funder of U.S. institutions of higher education from 2011 t0 2016 — surpassing some states even hundreds of times its size, such as China. Weinthal’s report ought to serve as a much-needed wakeup call for the more sclerotic elements of our bipartisan foreign policy ruling class. That ruling class is oftentimes overly deterred from meaningfully cracking down on Qatar by the U.S. military presence at Qatar’s Al Udeid Air Base. But it is ultimately myopic to permit our military’s presence at Al Udeid to pose an impregnable barrier to attempt to rein in this tiny but destructive nation. It is long past time for policymakers and the chattering class alike to arrive at the conclusion that Qatar is not our friend — at all."
conservative,"Perhaps the greatest misconception involving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is that, while the Palestinians may be more morally wrong, it is Israel who must do more to usher in peace. Truth is, nothing Israel offers will suffice, because Palestinian leadership has never wanted peace — nor even a two-state solution. It’s time the world acknowledges the true motives of Palestinian leadership: Either a “Judenrein Palestine” (a Jew-free Palestine) or sustained conflict that inspires the foreign aid that enriches the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) coffers. For the entirety of its existence, Palestinian-Arab leadership has championed anti-Semitism and violence — antitheses to peace. Cue Hajj Amin al-Husseini, an infamous Nazi collaborator and the first to spearhead Palestinian-Arab nationalism. As the grand mufti of Jerusalem, al-Husseini stopped at no cost to undermine Britain’s control over Mandatory Palestine. Al-Husseini allied with the Nazis and even recruited for the SS. He saluted Hitler, had a “close relationship” with SS Chief Heinrich Himmler — who masterminded the Holocaust, and proclaimed, “kill the Jews wherever you find them.” According to Professor Gilbert Archcar, al-Husseini even reached out to European leaders and “advocat[ed] that the Jews be sent to concentration camps instead of … Palestine.” Al-Husseini was complicit in Jewish genocide — and he championed those perpetrating it. Yasser Arafat echoed support for al-Husseini and his agenda. Arafat regarded al-Husseini as a “hero,” and observed: “We plan to eliminate … Israel and establish a purely Palestinian state. We will make life unbearable for Jews …” Arafat also chaired the terrorist Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). An organization whose “single purpose” was Israel’s destruction, the PLO has killed “thousands of civilians.” Mahmoud Abbas, the current president of the PA, has continued his predecessors’ anti-Semitism and jihadism. He has referred to Jews as “dirty,” and has incited murder, exclaiming, “Every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem is pure, every [martyr] will reach paradise.” And in 2018, the PA under Abbas directed $330 million to the PA Martyrs Fund, which sponsors stipends to terrorists and their families. Abbas’s anti-Semitism also includes Holocaust denial, the very focus of his dissertation: The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism And Zionist Movement. Abbas has also blamed “hatred against Jews” as a result of “their social profession.” He is undeniably anti-Semitic. Other political influences deserving mention are Hamas and Marwan Barghouti. Hamas, which governs Gaza, is a terrorist organization committed to Israel’s destruction. Hamas won the last Palestinian elections in 2006, and in late 2018, was regarded as the favorite to win the next elections. Further, Hamas has fought three wars with Israel since 2008, and has fired 17,000 rockets in that span. And polling suggests that Marwan Barghouti, founder of the militant al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and convicted murderer of 26 people, would win the next Palestinian election if selected as the candidate for Fatah — Abbas’ party. Hence, anti-Semitism and violence have corrupted Palestinian leadership. Peace is the last thing it wants, the first being Israel’s destruction and a Judenrein state — which is why PA law allows the death penalty to be imposed upon Palestinians who sell land to Jews. But if the PA cannot achieve Judenrein, it will settle for sustained conflict, which inspires the foreign aid that enriches the PA and allows it to expand its power. Sadly, Israel has demonstrated more commitment to a Palestinian state than has Palestinian leadership itself. Since 2000, Israel has proposed or accepted four land-for-peace proposals that would have created an independent Palestinian state. The PA has refused all proposals, despite one being so generous as to include all of Gaza, East Jerusalem, and 97% of Judea and Samaria. Palestinian self-sabotages at achieving statehood have been so in vain that Bill Clinton once lamented, “I killed myself trying to give Palestinians a state.” The PA’s motive, instead of statehood, is corruption — which “thrives” as conflict exists. Conflict fuels international attention and the foreign aid that the PA has exploited to line its pockets and fortify its bureaucracy. In 2015, it was reported that the PA had received $25 billion in foreign aid since 1994. Yet Palestinians “saw no improvement in their living conditions.” This sum should startle: Palestinian foreign aid, when assessed on a per capita basis, exceeds that designated for the Marshall Plan by 25 times. Unlike the Marshall Plan, which propelled Europe’s reconstruction in four years, the “Palestinian Project” has now lasted over a quarter of a century without any end in sight. So where has the money gone? Corruption. Arafat amassed $10+ billion, “[t]he main source” of which was “the approximately $6 billion contributed … as financial aid.” Further, Arafat’s financial advisor accumulated $500+ million, having had access to “hundreds of millions of [the PA’s] dollars.” Abbas also amassed approximately $100 million, despite being a career politician, and his two sons are millionaires who operate foreign aid contracting businesses. The PA suffers from systemic venality. Palestinian-Arab leadership has long realized that conflict must exist for it to receive aid. Thus, in 2018, it distributed $330 million worth of stipends to thousands of terrorists and their families, thereby inspiring future generations of terror. PA leadership also realizes that its power remains dependent on keeping the Palestinian people dependent on its reign. Hence, in 2016, “[m]ore than half” of the PA’s spending on Gaza was “spent on wages to PA employees.” Further, between 1999 and 2007, the PA recruited 70,000 new government officials, while spending 70% of the Paris Conference foreign aid package on government salaries in 2008, and 58% of its entire foreign aid for 2001 on PA salaries. Through inciting violence and dependency culture, the PA exploits conflict to preserve its power and wealth. In sum, Palestinian leadership has long been disingenuous. It wants not peace, but either a “Judenrein Palestine” or a conflict that will enable its corruption, power, and raison d’etre. If the world really wants a solution, it must stop blaming Israel, which has actually tried to establish a Palestinian state, and condemn the true motives of Palestinian leadership."
conservative,"In March 2003, then-President George W. Bush let a multinational land invasion of Iraq. At the time, ethnically diverse Iraq — one of the sundry Middle East states haphazardly crafted by clueless Europeans in the World War I-era Sykes-Picot Agreement — was run by thuggish Ba’athist strongman Saddam Hussein. Within weeks, Baghdad was held by U.S.-aligned forces. Less than a year later, Hussein was captured. But that was deemed woefully insufficient by Bush-era foreign policy hands. Operating under the intellectually hubristic and universal values-ridden guise of a White House “Freedom Agenda,” Bush-era foreign policy was not content to engage in Israel Defense Forces-style one-off “strike and maneuver” tactical hits against threatening jihadist outfits. Rather, the Bush administration, in tandem with its concurrent nation-building project in the third-world sharia backwater hellhole of Afghanistan, sought a more enduring physical presence in order to help birth a Madisonian republic in the war-torn, ethnically fractious Iraqi desert. The rest — with the exception of an Obama-era full troop withdrawal between the end of 2011 and our troops’ return in 2014 to fight the ascendant Islamic State Sunni death cult — is, as they say, history. In the year 2020, the U.S. retains a substantial physical military presence in Iraq. Following the just and proper strike last week of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force terrorist mastermind Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, it is now time for our U.S. troops in Iraq to come home. There is simply no longer any compelling strategic reason for the U.S. to retain a troop presence in Iraq, which is increasingly dominated by pro-Iran Shi’ite militias whose fealty is to no one other than the Quds Force and its mullah overlords. The day has long passed where true American influence in Iraq has been anything other than symbolic; the nation is, at this point, hardly distinguishable from its “Shi’ite Crescent” fellow nations of Syria and Lebanon in its status as an Iranian satrapy. It was only a matter of days ago when Iraqi security officials seemed, at best, ambivalent about Soleimani loyalist Shi’ite radicals storming the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The true threat in the region to the United States, as it has been ever since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, is the inherently jihadist regime in Tehran. Non-state Sunni jihadist actors, no matter the alphabet soup under which they organize, utterly pale in comparison. The threat of Sunni Islamist infiltration can largely be stanched by severely limiting entry visas from problematic Islamic nations, massively ramping up immigration interior enforcement, and engaging in occasional ad hoc drone strikes based from the U.S.’s already-manifold bases across the region. The strike that killed Soleimani, after all, was launched from Al Udeid Air Base in (deeply problematic “ally”) Qatar. The issue with leaving large-scale numbers of U.S. military assets, from a hardened realist perspective, is that it is actually counterproductive to our over-arching goal of deterring the Iranian menace. As Daniel Horowitz quite presciently warned even before last night’s missile launches from Iran into Iraq, “[c]ontinuing to leave so many assets in Iraq itself will just make us vulnerable to Iran’s attacks and counterattacks in the future.” And a higher-level goal such as deterring Iran necessarily takes hierarchical primacy over a tactic such as deploying troops to Iraq. As famed Prussian military strategist Carl von Clausewitz once said: First decide on one’s policy, then one’s strategy, and only then one’s tactics. In taking out Soleimani, the Ayatollah Khameini’s most trusted servant, the Trump administration clearly communicated to the Tehran mullocracy that America will always zealously guard and defend our national interests, as we carefully demarcate and define them. We no longer need to be involved in the dreadful and feckless task of nation-building. As Lee Smith compellingly writes today at the New York Post, “Trump carved out his own exit strategy” via the Soleimani strike."
conservative,"Some of the Democratic candidates for president support studying reparations to blacks to compensate for slavery. But in many ways, America has made reparations to blacks. What are race-based preferences if not a form of compensation for historical wrongs? Many cities have “set-aside” programs that award government contracts to minority contractors. President Lyndon Johnson pushed his Great Society programs to “end poverty and racial injustice.” But few think of the federal government’s housing policy, particularly the Community Reinvestment Act, or the CRA, as a form of reparations. But that is exactly what it was and still is. In many ways, the so-called Great Recession of the late 2000s was a product of affirmative action and a form of reparations gone bad. Really bad. In 1999, almost a decade before the Great Recession, the libertarian Cato Institute issued a warning about the CRA, which President Jimmy Carter signed in 1977. The CRA was based on the assumption that racist lenders denied mortgages to credit-worthy would-be borrowers, particularly minority applicants. The act initially merely sought data on banking practices to encourage lenders to practice fairness in granting mortgages. But President Bill Clinton, in 1995, added teeth to the CRA. Economists Stephen Moore and Lawrence Kudlow explained: “Under Clinton’s Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary, Andrew Cuomo, Community Reinvestment Act regulators gave banks higher ratings for home loans made in ‘credit-deprived’ areas. Banks were effectively rewarded for throwing out sound underwriting standards and writing loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting. If banks didn’t comply with these rules, regulators reined in their ability to expand lending and deposits. “These new HUD rules lowered down payments from the traditional 20 percent to 3 percent by 1995 and zero down-payments by 2000. What’s more, in the Clinton push to issue home loans to lower income borrowers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made a common practice to virtually end credit documentation, low credit scores were disregarded, and income and job history was also thrown aside. The phrase ‘subprime’ became commonplace. What an understatement.” But is it true that banks were discriminating against minority borrowers? CATO, in 1999, said despite widespread accusations and lawsuits alleging discriminatory lending, the facts show otherwise. CATO said: “Researchers using the best available data find very little discernible home-mortgage lending discrimination based on area, race, sex or ethnic origin. … “Other well-structured studies also found no evidence of redlining or unwarranted geographic discrimination. Thus, the claim that lenders redlined or were biased in making loans for the purchase of homes in central cities is not supported. Nor did the studies find that financial institutions discriminated against actual or potential borrowers on the basis of the racial or ethnic composition of neighborhoods.” What caused this narrative that racist banks refused would-be minority borrowers? Enter lawyers like then private citizen and attorney Barack Obama. In 1995, Obama, representing 186 blacks, filed a class action mortgage discrimination lawsuit against Citibank. The case was settled, and his clients got mortgages. But, according to the Daily Caller in 2012, just 19 of Obamas 186 clients still had their homes. About half had gone bankrupt and/or had their homes in foreclosure. Incredibly, at least two of his former clients now believe banks should be prevented from lending to people who otherwise cannot afford their homes. One client said: “If you see some people don’t make enough money to afford the mortgage, why should you give them a loan? There should be some type of regulation against giving people loans they can’t afford.” Lending standards became so lax that virtually anyone who could fog up a mirror got a home. Then along came the recession, and a lot of people lost homes that they would not have bought in the first place but for lax lending standards. The result? According to the Federal Reserve, from 2010 to 2013, white household median net worth — a household’s assets minus its liabilities — increased 2.4%. But black net worth fell from $16,600 to $11,000, a four-year drop of 34%. As another of Obama’s former clients put it, “(Banks) were too eager to lend money to many who didn’t qualify.” In 1999, the Cato policy paper on the CRA made the following recommendation: “The Clinton administration wants an even stricter CRA. But more than two decades of its operation suggest that repealing rather than tightening the act would be the economically and socially responsible thing to do.” Too bad nobody listened. Share"
